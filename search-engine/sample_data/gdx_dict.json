Multiple genetic and epigenetic factors regulate this dynamic process; however, the function of specific microRNAs in germ layer differentiation remains unknown. In this study, we established that microRNA-127 (miR-127) is related to germ layer specification via microRNA array analysis of isolated three germ layers of E7.5 mouse embryos and was verified through differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. miR-127 is highly expressed in endoderm and primitive streak. Overexpression of miR-127 increases and inhibition of miR-127 decreases the expression of mesendoderm markers. We further show that miR-127 promotes mesendoderm differentiation through the nodal pathway, a determinative signaling pathway in early embryogenesis. Using luciferase reporter assay, left-right determination factor 2 (Lefty2), an antagonist of nodal, is identified to be a novel target of miR-127. Furthermore, the role of miR-127 in mesendoderm differentiation is attenuated by Lefty2 overexpression.

Here, we investigated the role of the sex chromosomes in causing sex differences in myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used two unique mouse models, the 'four core genotypes' [XX mice with ovaries (XXF) or testes (XXM) and XY mice with ovaries (XYF) or testes (XYM)] and XY* (gonadal male or female mice with one or two X chromosomes). All mice were gonadectomized (GDX). In vivo or isolated Langendorff-perfused hearts were subjected to I/R injury. The in vivo infarct size in XY mice was significantly smaller than XX mice regardless of their gonadal type (24.5 +/- 4.1% in XYF and 21.8 +/- 3.3% in XYM vs. 37.0 +/- 3.2% in XXF and 35.5 +/- 2.1% in XXM, P < 0.01). Consistent with the results in vivo, the infarct size was markedly smaller and cardiac functional recovery was significantly better in XY mice compared with XX ex vivo. The mitochondrial calcium retention capacity was significantly higher in XY compared with XX mice (nmol/mg protein: XXF = 126 +/- 9 and XXM = 192 +/- 45 vs. XYF = 250 +/- 56 and XYM = 286 +/- 51, P < 0.05). In XY* mice, mice with 2X chromosomes had larger infarct size (2X females = 41.4 +/- 8.9% and 2X males = 46.3 +/- 9.5% vs. 1X females = 23.7 +/- 3.9% and 1X males = 26.6 +/- 6.9%, P < 0.05) and lower heart functional recovery, compared with those with 1X chromosome. Several X genes that escape X inactivation (Eif2s3x, Kdm6a, and Kdm5c) showed higher expression in XX than in XY hearts.

We observed that mutant mice where HIF-1 is transcriptionally activated in myeloid cells (by deletion of the von Hippel-Lindau gene) resulted in erythema, enhanced neovascularization in matrigel plugs, and increased production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the bone marrow, all of which were completely abrogated by either genetic or pharmacological inactivation of HIF-1.

We conditionally deleted Dicer in mouse pituitary from embryonic day (E) 9.5 through Cre-mediated recombination. In situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed that Dicer is essential for pituitary morphogenesis and correct expression of hormones. Strikingly, alphaGSU (alpha glycoprotein subunit, common to three pituitary hormones) was absent in Dicer-deleted pituitaries. alphaGSU mRNA is unstable and its half-life increases during pituitary development. A transcriptome-wide analysis of microdissected E12.5 pituitaries revealed a significant increment of KSRP expression in conditional Dicer-deleted mice. We found that KSRP directly binds to alphaGSU mRNA, promoting its rapid decay; and, during pituitary development, alphaGSU expression displays an inverse temporal relationship to KSRP. Further, let-7b/c downregulated KSRP expression, promoting the degradation of its mRNA by directly binding to the 3'UTR. Therefore, we propose a model in which let-7b/c and KSRP operate within a negative feedback loop. Starting from E12.5, KSRP induces the maturation of let-7b/c that, in turn, post-transcriptionally downregulates the expression of KSRP itself.

In the current study, we sought to determine if CXCR2 ligand concentration is responsible for the divergent effects of these mediators on liver regeneration after ischemia/reperfusion injury and partial hepatectomy. METHODS: Murine models of partial ischemia/reperfusion injury and hepatectomy were used to study the effect of CXCR2 ligands on liver regeneration. RESULTS: We found that hepatic expression of the CXCR2 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), was significantly increased after both I/R injury and partial hepatectomy. However, expression of these ligands after I/R injury was 30-100-fold greater than after hepatectomy. Interestingly, the same pattern of expression was found in ischemic versus non-ischemic liver lobes following I/R injury with expression significantly greater in the ischemic liver lobes. In both systems, lower ligand expression was associated with increased hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration in a CXCR2-dependent fashion. To confirm that these effects were related to ligand concentration, we administered exogenous MIP-2 and KC to mice undergoing partial hepatectomy. Mice received a \"high\" dose that replicated serum levels found after I/R injury and a \"low\" dose that was similar to that found after hepatectomy.

The approach utilizes microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and a combination of site-specific loxP insertion, telomere-directed chromosome truncation, and precise reciprocal translocation for the generation of Tc mice. Human chromosome 21 (hChr.21) was modified with a loxP site and truncated in homologous recombination-proficient chicken DT40 cells.

The mechanisms underlying these processes, however, remain largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the role of dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. METHODS AND RESULTS: Platelet-derived growth factor-BB induced DOCK2 expression while modulating SMC phenotype. DOCK2 deficiency diminishes platelet-derived growth factor-BB or serum-induced downregulation of SMC markers. Conversely, DOCK2 overexpression inhibits SMC marker expression in primary cultured SMC. Mechanistically, DOCK2 inhibits myocardin expression, blocks serum response factor nuclear location, attenuates myocardin binding to serum response factor, and thus attenuates myocardin-induced smooth muscle marker promoter activity. Moreover, DOCK2 and Kruppel-like factor 4 cooperatively inhibit myocardin-serum response factor interaction. In a rat carotid artery balloon-injury model, DOCK2 is induced in media layer SMC initially and neointima SMC subsequently after vascular injury. Knockdown of DOCK2 dramatically inhibits the neointima formation by 60%. Most importantly, knockout of DOCK2 in mice markedly blocks ligation-induced intimal hyperplasia while restoring SMC contractile protein expression.

METHODS: Female LDLR(-/-) and wild-type mice were used to study the effect of the LDLR(-/-) genotype on thyroid hormone metabolism. RESULTS: LDLR(-/-) mice had a higher concentration of nuclear SREBP-1, higher concentrations of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in plasma, a lower expression of relevant UGT1A isoforms, reduced activities of pNP-UGT, T(3)-UGT and T(4)-UGT and a lower mRNA and protein concentration of AhR in the liver than wild-type mice (P<0.05). Plasma concentration of TSH, mRNA concentrations of various genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis in the thyroid, activity of deiodinase and mRNA concentrations of two thyroid hormone responsive genes, CYP7A1 and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, in the liver did not differ between both genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that LDLR(-/-) mice have increased concentrations of thyroid hormones in plasma. This effect is probably due to an inhibition of thyroid hormone glucuronidation, which might be caused by down-regulation of UGT genes due to a reduced expression of AhR.

The goal of the current study was to analyze in which midbrain neuronal subgroups Uncx4.1 is expressed and to examine whether this factor plays a role in the early development of these neuronal subgroups. RESULTS: We have shown that Uncx4.1 is expressed in GABAergic, glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurons in the mouse midbrain. In midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons Uncx4.1 expression is particularly high around E11.5 and strongly diminished already at E17.5. The analysis of knockout mice revealed that the loss of Uncx4.1 is accompanied with a 25% decrease in the population of mDA neurons, as marked by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT), Pitx3 and Ngn2. In contrast, the number of glutamatergic Pax6-positive cells was augmented, while the GABAergic neuron population appears not affected in Uncx4.1-deficient embryos. CONCLUSION: We conclude that Uncx4.1 is implicated in the development of mDA neurons where it displays a unique temporal expression profile in the early postmitotic stage. Our data indicate that the mechanism underlying the role of Uncx4.1 in mDA development is likely related to differentiation processes in postmitotic stages, and where Ngn2 is engaged.

A HITS-CLIP (high-throughput sequencing cross-linking immunoprecipitation)-generated map of reproducible Ptbp2-RNA interactions in the developing mouse neocortex, combined with results from splicing-sensitive microarrays, demonstrated that the major action of Ptbp2 is to inhibit adult-specific alternative exons by binding pyrimidine-rich sequences upstream of and/or within them. These regulated exons are present in mRNAs encoding proteins associated with control of cell fate, proliferation, and the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting a role for Ptbp2 in neurogenesis. Indeed, neuronal progenitors in the Ptbp2-null brain exhibited an aberrant polarity and were associated with regions of premature neurogenesis and reduced progenitor pools.

Notch signaling controls self-renewal of myogenic progenitors as well as satellite cell homing during formation of trunk muscle, but its role in craniofacial muscles has been little investigated. We show here that the pool of myogenic progenitor cells in craniofacial muscle of Dll1(LacZ/Ki) mutant mice is depleted in early fetal development, which is accompanied by a major deficit in muscle growth. At the expense of progenitor cells, supernumerary differentiating myoblasts appear transiently and these express MyoD. The progenitor pool in craniofacial muscle of Dll1(LacZ/Ki) mutants is largely rescued by an additional mutation of MyoD. We conclude from this that Notch exerts its decisive role in craniofacial myogenesis by repression of MyoD. This function is similar to the one previously observed in trunk myogenesis, and is thus conserved in cranial and trunk muscle. However, in cranial mesoderm-derived progenitors, Notch signaling is not required for Pax7 expression and impinges little on the homing of satellite cells.

NOTCH activation in ESCs promotes the acquisition of a neural fate, whereas its suppression favours their differentiation into cardiomyocytes. This suggests that NOTCH signalling is implicated in the acquisition of distinct embryonic fates at early stages of mammalian development. In order to investigate in vivo such a role for NOTCH signalling in shaping cell fate specification, we use genetic approaches to constitutively activate the NOTCH pathway in the mouse embryo. Early embryonic development, including the establishment of anterior-posterior polarity, is not perturbed by forced NOTCH activation. By contrast, widespread NOTCH activity in the epiblast triggers dramatic gastrulation defects. These are fully rescued in a RBPJ-deficient background. Epiblast-specific NOTCH activation induces acquisition of neurectoderm identity and disrupts the formation of specific mesodermal precursors including the derivatives of the anterior primitive streak, the mouse organiser.

In these studies we examined the role of hepatocyte ARNT in the thioacetamide (TAA)-induced model of liver fibrosis. METHODS: Hepatocyte-specific ARNT-null (LARNT) mice were created using an albumin promoter-driven Cre recombinase. LARNT and floxed control (FC) littermates were placed on chow diet and received twice weekly intraperitoneal injections of 0.15mg/g body weight of TAA for 13 weeks. RESULTS: TAA treated LARNT and FC mice had a similar pattern of fibrosis. Quantification of Sirius red histology staining and hydroxyproline content revealed mixed results in terms of collagen deposition in LARNT livers. There was no significant difference in hepatocyte apoptosis or proliferation, as assessed by cleaved Caspase-3 and Ki67 respectively.

This report examines whether Zic genes' involvement in inner ear development is a tenable hypothesis based on their expression patterns. RESULTS: In the developing inner ear of both the chick and mouse, all of the Zic genes were expressed in the dorsal neural tube and variably in the periotic mesenchyme, but expression of the Zic genes in the otic epithelium was not found. The onset of expression differed among the Zic genes; within any given region surrounding the otic epithelium, multiple Zic genes were expressed in the same place at the same time.

To investigate how embryonic cardiomyocytes respond to metabolic stress in vivo, we utilized tissue mosaicism for mitochondrial dysfunction in 13.5dpc mouse hearts. The latter is based on inactivation of the X-linked gene encoding Holocytochrome c synthase (Hccs), which is essential for mitochondrial respiration. In heterozygous heart conditional Hccs knockout females (cHccs(+/-)) random X chromosomal inactivation results in a mosaic of healthy and HCCS deficient cells in the myocardium. Microarray RNA expression analyses identified genes involved in unfolded protein response (UPR) and programmed cell death as differentially expressed in cHccs(+/-) versus control embryonic hearts. Activation of the UPR is localized to HCCS deficient cardiomyocytes but does not involve ER stress pathways, suggesting that it is caused by defective mitochondria. Consistently, mitochondrial chaperones, such as HSP10 and HSP60, but not ER chaperones are induced in defective cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction can result in oxidative stress, but no evidence for excessive ROS (reactive oxygen species) production was observed in cHccs(+/-) hearts. Instead, the antioxidative proteins SOD2 and PRDX3 are induced, suggesting that ROS detoxification prevents oxidative damage in HCCS deficient cardiomyocytes. Mitochondrial dysfunction and unrestricted UPR can induce cell death, and we detected the initiation of upstream events of both intrinsic as well as extrinsic apoptosis in cHccs(+/-) hearts. Cell death is not executed, however, suggesting the activation of antiapoptotic mechanisms. Whereas most apoptosis inhibitors are either unchanged or downregulated in HCCS deficient cardiomyocytes, Bcl-2 and ARC (apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain) are induced. Given that ARC can inhibit both apoptotic pathways as well as necrosis and attenuates UPR, we generated cHccs(+/-) embryos on an Arc knockout background (cHccs(+/-),Arc(-/-)). Surprisingly, the absence of ARC does not induce cell death in embryonic or postnatal HCCS deficient cardiomyocytes and adult cHccs(+/-),Arc(-/-) mice exhibit normal cardiac morphology and function.

Furthermore, by removing Gli2 in Gli3 temporal conditional knock-outs, we uncovered an essential role for Gli2 in providing the remaining posterior limb patterning seen in Gli3 single mutants. To test whether GLIAs or GLIRs regulate different aspects of AP limb patterning and/or digit number, we utilized a knock-in allele in which GLI1, which functions solely as an activator, is expressed in place of the bifunctional GLI2 protein.

Here we show that in both human and mouse, expression of the ZG isoform 3beta-HSD is rapidly induced upon angiotensin II (AngII) stimulation. AngII is the key peptide hormone regulating the capacity of aldosterone synthesis. Using the human adrenocortical H295R cells as a model system, we show that the ZG isoform HSD3B1 differs from HSD3B2 in the ability to respond to AngII. Mechanistically, the induction of HSD3B1 involves de novo protein synthesis of the nuclear orphan receptors NGFIB and NURR1. The HSD3B1 promoter contains a functional NGFIB/NURR1-responsive element to which these proteins bind in response to AngII. Knockdown of these proteins and overexpression of a dominant negative NGFIB both reduce the AngII responsiveness of HSD3B1. Thus, the AngII-NGFIB/NURR1 pathway controls HSD3B1. Our work reveals HSD3B1 as a new regulatory target of AngII.", "publish_time": "2014-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 7, "other diagram": 1, "macromolecule sequence": 5, "gel/blot": 3, "3D structure": 14}}, "5648580": {"cord_uid": "5648580", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Enhancers compete with a long non-coding RNA for regulation of the Kcnq1 domain.", "abstract": "The imprinted Kcnq1 domain contains a differentially methylated region (KvDMR) in intron 11 of Kcnq1.

The KvDMR encompasses the Kcnq1ot1 promoter, CTCF sites and other DNA elements, whose individual contribution to regulation of the endogenous domain is unknown.

Significant progress has been made in deciphering the basic building blocks composing the AIS, but the underlying mechanisms required for AIS formation remains unclear. The scaffolding protein ankyrin-G is the master-organizer of the AIS. Microtubules and their interactors, particularly end-binding proteins (EBs), have emerged as potential key players in AIS formation. Here, we show that the longest isoform of ankyrin-G (480AnkG) selectively associates with EBs via its specific tail domain and that this interaction is crucial for AIS formation and neuronal polarity in cultured rodent hippocampal neurons. EBs are essential for 480AnkG localization and stabilization at the AIS, whereas 480AnkG is required for the specific accumulation of EBs in the proximal axon. Our findings thus provide a conceptual framework for understanding how the cooperative relationship between 480AnkG and EBs induces the assembly of microtubule-AIS structures in the proximal axon.

Although cranial neural crest cells of Foxi3 mutants are able to migrate, populate the branchial arches, and display some elements of correct proximo-distal patterning, they succumb to apoptosis from embryonic day 9.75 onwards.

In line with this, DINE-deficient (DINE KO) embryos fail to arborize phrenic motor nerves in the diaphragm and to form proper neuromuscular junctions (NMJ), which lead to death shortly after birth. However, it is unclear whether protease activity of DINE is involved in motor nerve terminal arborization and how DINE participates in the process. To address these issues, we performed an in vivo rescue experiment in which three types of motor-neuron specific DINE transgenic mice were crossed with DINE KO mice.

We have used a genetic trick that eliminates dividing cells by apoptosis in order to assess the contribution of differentiated corticotropes and melanotropes for maintenance of their population in the adult pituitary. The system relies on chromosome instability created by the action of the Cre recombinase on inverted loxP sites. Expression of Cre recombinase in corticotropes and melanotropes led to progressive loss of corticotropes whereas melanotropes were unaffected. Because the Cre transgene is not expressed in progenitors, the data indicate that maintenance of the adult corticotrope pool is primarily due to self-duplication of differentiated cells. In contrast, melanotropes do not divide. Maintenance of corticotropes by self-duplication contrasts with the reported proliferative response of undifferentiated cells observed after adrenalectomy.

While much progress has been made regarding the mechanisms which regulate contralateral topography, very little is known of the mechanisms which regulate the mapping of ipsilateral axons such that they align with their contralateral counterparts. RESULTS: Using the advantageous model provided by the mouse retinocollicular pathway, we have performed anterograde tracing experiments which demonstrate that ipsilateral retinal axons begin to form terminal zones (TZs) in the superior colliculus (SC), within the first few postnatal days. These appear mature by postnatal day 11. Importantly, TZs formed by ipsilaterally-projecting retinal axons are spatially offset from those of contralaterally-projecting axons arising from the same retinotopic location from the outset. This pattern is consistent with that required for adult visuotopy. We further demonstrate that a member of the Ten-m/Odz/Teneurin family of homophilic transmembrane glycoproteins, Ten-m3, is an essential regulator of ipsilateral retinocollicular topography. Ten-m3 mRNA is expressed in a high-medial to low-lateral gradient in the developing SC. This corresponds topographically with its high-ventral to low-dorsal retinal gradient. In Ten-m3 knockout mice, contralateral ventrotemporal axons appropriately target rostromedial SC, whereas ipsilateral axons exhibit dramatic targeting errors along both the mediolateral and rostrocaudal axes of the SC, with a caudal shift of the primary TZ, as well as the formation of secondary, caudolaterally displaced TZs. In addition to these dramatic ipsilateral-specific mapping errors, both contralateral and ipsilateral retinocollicular TZs exhibit more subtle changes in morphology. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that important aspects of adult visuotopy are established via the differential sensitivity of ipsilateral and contralateral axons to intrinsic guidance cues.

Therefore, we analyzed the morphological, cellular, and molecular changes caused by inactivation of Dlx1 and Dlx2 as related to palate development. Results: Dlx1/2-/- mutants exhibited lack of vertical growth in the posterior palate during the earliest stage of palatogenesis. We attributed this growth deficiency to reduced cell proliferation. Expression of a cell cycle regulator Ccnd1 was specifically down-regulated in the same region. Previous studies established that the epithelial-mesenchymal signaling loop involving Shh, Bmp4, and Fgf10 is important for cell proliferation and tissue growth during palate development. This signaling loop was disrupted in Dlx1/2-/- palate. Interestingly, however, the decreases in Ccnd1 expression and mitosis in Dlx1/2-/- mutants were independent of this signaling loop. Finally, Dlx1/2 activity was required for normal expression of several transcription factor genes whose mutation results in palate defects. Conclusions: The functions of Dlx1 and Dlx2 are crucial for the initial formation of the posterior palatal shelves, and that the Dlx genes lie upstream of multiple signaling molecules and transcription factors important for later stages of palatogenesis.

Significant expression differences were identified on a single platform and tracked over a behaviorally relevant time course that covered each stage of alcohol addiction; i.e., after chronic intoxication, during peak withdrawal, and after a defined period of abstinence. Females were more sensitive to ethanol with higher fold expression differences. Bioinformatics showed a strong effect of sex on the data structure of expression profiles during chronic intoxication and at peak withdrawal irrespective of genetic background. However, during abstinence, differences were observed instead between the lines/phenotypes irrespective of sex. Confirmation of identified pathways showed distinct inflammatory signaling following intoxication at peak withdrawal, with a pro-inflammatory phenotype in females but overall suppression of immune signaling in males. Combined, these results suggest that each stage of the addiction cycle is influenced differentially by sex vs. genetic background and support the development of stage- and sex-specific therapies for alcohol withdrawal and the maintenance of sobriety.", "publish_time": "2014-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 4, "light microscopy": 1, "3D structure": 3, "gel/blot": 6}}, "6101597": {"cord_uid": "6101597", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Runx2 contributes to the regenerative potential of the mammary epithelium.", "abstract": "Although best known for its role in bone development and associated structures the transcription factor RUNX2 is expressed in a wide range of lineages, including those of the mammary gland.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether topical ocular sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) treatment rescues glaucoma phenotypes in a mouse model of myocilin-associated glaucoma (Tg-MYOC(Y437H) mice). METHODS: Tg-MYOC(Y437H) mice were treated with PBA eye drops (n = 10) or sterile PBS (n = 8) twice daily for 5 months. Long-term safety and effectiveness of topical PBA (0.2%) on glaucoma phenotypes were examined by measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) and pattern ERG (PERG), performing slit lamp evaluation of the anterior chamber, analyzing histologic sections of the anterior segment, and comparing myocilin levels in the aqueous humor and trabecular meshwork of Tg-MYOC(Y437H) mice. RESULTS: Tg-MYOC(Y437H) mice developed elevated IOP at 3 months of age when compared with wild-type (WT) littermates (n = 24; P < 0.0001). Topical PBA did not alter IOP in WT mice. However, it significantly reduced elevated IOP in Tg-MYOC(Y437H) mice to the level of WT mice. Topical PBA-treated Tg-MYOC(Y437H) mice also preserved PERG amplitudes compared with vehicle-treated Tg-MYOC(Y437H) mice. No structural abnormalities were observed in the anterior chamber of PBA-treated WT and Tg-MYOC(Y437H) mice. Analysis of the myocilin in the aqueous humor and TM revealed that PBA significantly improved the secretion of myocilin and reduced myocilin accumulation as well as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the TM of Tg-MYOC(Y437H) mice. Furthermore, topical PBA reduced IOP elevated by induction of ER stress via tunicamycin injections in WT mice.

We show here that the odd-skipped related-1 (Osr1) transcription factor is expressed throughout the neural crest-derived tongue mesenchyme in mouse, but not in chick, embryos during early tongue morphogenesis. Neural crest-specific inactivation of Osr1 resulted in formation of an ectopic cartilage in the mouse tongue, reminiscent in shape and developmental ontogeny of the anterior tongue cartilage in chick. SRY-box containing gene-9 (Sox9), the master regulator of chondrogenesis, is widely expressed in the nascent tongue mesenchyme at the onset of tongue morphogenesis but its expression is dramatically down-regulated concomitant with activation of Osr1 expression in the developing mouse tongue. In Osr1 mutant mouse embryos, expression of Sox9 persisted in the developing tongue mesenchyme where chondrogenesis is subsequently activated to form the ectopic cartilage. Furthermore, we show that Osr1 binds to the Sox9 gene promoter and that overexpression of Osr1 suppressed expression of endogenous Sox9 mRNAs and Sox9 promoter-driven reporter.

Selective silencing of ATM LPL decreased foam cell formation in visceral adipose tissue of obese mice, consistent with a reduced supply of fatty acids from VLDL hydrolysis. Unexpectedly, silencing LPL also decreased the expression of genes involved in fatty acid uptake (CD36) and esterification in ATMs. This deficit in fatty acid uptake capacity was associated with increased circulating serum free fatty acids.

The Kcnq1 imprinted domain exhibits complex tissue-specific expression patterns co-existing with a domain-wide cis-acting control element. Transcription of the paternally expressed antisense non-coding RNA Kcnq1ot1 silences some neighboring genes in the embryo, while others are unaffected. Kcnq1 is imprinted in early cardiac development but becomes biallelic after midgestation. To explore this phenomenon and the role of Kcnq1ot1, we used allele-specific assays and chromosome conformational studies in wild-type mice and mice with a premature termination mutation for Kcnq1ot1. We show that Kcnq1 imprinting in early heart is established and maintained independently of Kcnq1ot1 expression, thus excluding a role for Kcnq1ot1 in repressing Kcnq1, even while silencing other genes in the domain. The exact timing of the mono- to biallelic transition is strain-dependent, with the CAST/EiJ allele becoming activated earlier and acquiring higher levels than the C57BL/6J allele. Unexpectedly, Kcnq1ot1 itself also switches to biallelic expression specifically in the heart, suggesting that tissue-specific loss of imprinting may be common during embryogenesis. The maternal Kcnq1ot1 transcript is shorter than the paternal ncRNA, and its activation depends on an alternative transcriptional start site that bypasses the maternally methylated promoter. Production of Kcnq1ot1 on the maternal chromosome does not silence Cdkn1c.

Upregulation of the cytokines interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), KC (also termed CXC ligand 1 [CXCL1]), and IL-17A occurred following inoculation with intranasal S. aureus.

Here we demonstrate that the presence of a burn wound dramatically affects expression of both human (hGSTA4) and mouse (mGsta4) 4HNE scavengers. hGSTA4 is down-regulated significantly within 1 wk of thermal burn injury in the muscle and fat tissues of patients from the large-scale collaborative Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury multicentered study. Similarly, mGsta4, the murine GST with the highest catalytic efficiency for 4HNE, is down-regulated to approximately half of normal levels in mouse muscle immediately postburn. Consequently, 4HNE protein adducts are increased 4- to 5-fold in mouse muscle postburn. Using an open wound infection model, we show that deletion of mGsta4 renders mice more susceptible to infection with the prevalent wound pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while muscle hGSTA4 expression negatively correlates with burn wound infection episodes per patient.

Specific and differential cell adhesion is expected to be instrumental in induction, migration, and differentiation of NCC. As p120 catenin (ctn) is an important component of cadherin-catenin cell adhesion complexes, we assessed its role in development of the anterior segment structure. METHODS: We generated conditional p120ctn(fl/fl);Wnt1Cre knockout mice and studied the effect of this gene ablation on eye development in vivo. In addition, p120ctn was knocked down in vitro. RESULTS: Wnt1Cre-mediated deletion of floxed p120ctn alleles in NCC resulted in serious ocular anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD), including iridocorneal angle closure, complete anterior chamber obliteration, iris and ciliary body hypoplasia, corneal malformation and opacity, and glaucoma-like defects. A completely penetrant phenotype was visible approximately three weeks after birth, but histologic defects were obvious at embryonal day 18.5 (E18.5). Neither migration of NCC nor expression of key transcription factors appeared to be affected. In contrast, the N-cadherin expression pattern was changed significantly in iridocorneal angle cells and corneal endothelium. A human trabecular meshwork cell line in which p120ctn was knocked down also showed decreased expression levels of N-cadherin and beta-catenin at the plasma membrane, but no defect in cell migration. CONCLUSIONS: p120ctn has a critical role in ocular mesenchyme development.

SMAD1 is a canonical nuclear mediator of BMP signaling, the activity of which is critically regulated through its interaction partners. We screened a mouse embryonic heart yeast two-hybrid library using Smad1 as bait and identified SERTAD1 as a novel interaction partner of SMAD1.

The overexpression of SERTAD1 in cardiomyocytes not only enhanced the activity of two BMP reporters in a dose-dependent manner but also increased the expression of several known BMP/SMAD regulatory targets.

Along these lines they detect the LeX glycan primarily on Nestin-positive NPCs at that age. Moreover, we show that spinal cord NPCs cultured as free floating neurospheres display a high immunoreactivity to both antibodies. In that context, we also demonstrate that the 487(LeX) antibody can be used to deplete a subpopulation of neurosphere forming NPCs from a mixed E13.5 spinal cord cell suspension. Towards the end of embryogenesis the overall immunoreactivity to both antibodies increases and the staining appears very diffuse.

However, the immunoreactivity to both antibodies appears only to be marginally affected in the absence of Tenascin C, arguing against Tenascin C being the major LeX carrier.

Mutant males and females showed significantly higher respiratory quotients (RQ) and lower energy output, resulting from a higher volume of CO(2) output and lower volume of O(2) consumption. Deletion mutant females were significantly less active than controls; they had higher levels of total serum ghrelin and ate more food. Mutant females also had lower serum insulin and higher glucagon. In contrast, deletion mutant males were not hyperphagic, but they were more active and spent less time sleeping. Adiponectin and resistin, both products of adipocytes, were increased in male and female mutant mice. In addition, mutant males showed an increase in circulating levels of the potent lipogenic hormone, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide. Taken together, these results indicate that mutant mice may become obese due to a reduction in lipid oxidation and energy expenditure. This may stem from GH deficiency. Reduced fat oxidation and enhanced insulin sensitivity (in females) are directly related to GH deficiency in mutant mice because GH has been shown by others to increase insulin sensitivity and fat oxidation and reduce carbohydrate oxidation. Gender-dependent alterations in metabolic signals may further exacerbate the future obese phenotype and affect the timing of its onset. Females show a delay in onset of obesity, perhaps because of their low serum insulin, which is lipogenic, whereas young males already have higher levels of the lipogenic hormone, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide.

METHODS: We investigated which brain cell types express MLC1, compared developmental expression in mice and men, and studied the consequences of loss of MLC1 in Mlc1-null mice. RESULTS: Like humans, mice expressed MLC1 only in astrocytes, especially those facing fluid-brain barriers. In mice, MLC1 expression increased until 3 weeks and then stabilized. In humans, MLC1 expression was highest in the first year, decreased, and stabilized from approximately 5 years. Mlc1-null mice had early onset megalencephaly and increased brain water content. From 3 weeks, abnormal astrocytes were present with swollen processes abutting fluid-brain barriers. From 3 months, widespread white matter vacuolization with intramyelinic edema developed. Mlc1-null astrocytes showed slowed regulatory volume decrease and reduced volume-regulated anion currents, which increased upon MLC1 re-expression.

Deletion of EGFR prevented endogenous and mechanical stretch-induced type II cell differentiation via the ERK pathway, which was rescued by overexpression of a constitutively active MEK. Interestingly, the expression of ErbB4, the only ErbB receptor that EGFR co-precipitates in wild-type cells, was decreased in EGFR-deficient type II cells. Similar to EGFR, ErbB4 was activated by stretch and participated in ERK phosphorylation and type II cell differentiation. However, neuregulin (NRG) or stretch-induced ErbB4 activation were blunted in EGFR-deficient cells and not rescued after ErbB4 overexpression, suggesting that induction of ErbB4 phosphorylation is EGFR-dependent.

The induction of CRCs is also reversible, and removal of Y-27632 and feeders allows the cells to differentiate normally. Thus, when CRCs from ectocervical epithelium or tracheal epithelium are placed in an air-liquid interface culture system, the cervical cells form a well differentiated stratified squamous epithelium, whereas the tracheal cells form a ciliated airway epithelium.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the contribution of pSHF cells, labeled by lipophilic dye at the 4- to 6-somite stage, to regions of the heart at 20 to 25 somites, using mouse embryo culture. Cells more cranial in the pSHF contribute to the atrioventricular canal (AVC) and atria, whereas those more caudal generate the sinus venosus, but there is intermixing of fate throughout the pSHF. Caudal pSHF contributes symmetrically to the sinus venosus, but the fate of cranial pSHF is left/right asymmetrical. Left pSHF moves to dorsal left atrium and superior AVC, whereas right pSHF contributes to right atrium, ventral left atrium, and inferior AVC. Retrospective clonal analysis shows the relationships between AVC and atria to be clonal and that right and left progenitors diverge before first and second heart lineage separation. Cranial pSHF cells also contribute to the outflow tract: proximal and distal at 4 somites, and distal only at 6 somites.

Functionally, yolk sac-derived chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2(-) macrophages are instrumental in coronary development where they are required for remodeling of the primitive coronary plexus. Mechanistically, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2(-) macrophages are recruited to coronary blood vessels at the onset of coronary perfusion where they mediate coronary plexus remodeling through selective expansion of perfused vasculature.

So far, BWS development has been attributed entirely to the deregulation of proliferation caused by loss of p57-mediated CDK inhibition. However, a fraction of BWS patients have point mutations in CDKN1C located outside of the CDK inhibitory region, suggesting the involvement of other parts of the protein in the disease. To test this possibility, we generated knock-in mice deficient for p57-mediated cyclin-CDK inhibition (p57(CK) (-) ), the only clearly defined function of p57. Comparative analysis of p57(CK) (-) and p57(KO) mice provided clear evidence for CDK-independent roles of p57 and revealed that BWS is not caused entirely by CDK deregulation, as several features of BWS are caused by the loss of CDK-independent roles of p57. Thus, while the genetic origin of BWS is well understood, our results underscore that the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unclear. To probe these mechanisms further, we determined the p57 interactome.

Hence, we generated a knock-in mouse expressing a hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope-tagged DAT to study endogenous transporter trafficking. Introduction of the HA tag into the second extracellular loop of mouse DAT did not perturb its expression level, distribution pattern, or substrate uptake kinetics. Live-cell fluorescence microscopy imaging using fluorescently labeled HA-specific antibody and a quantitative HA-antibody endocytosis assay demonstrated that in axons HA-DAT was primarily located in the plasma membrane and internalized mostly in growth cones and varicosities, where synaptic vesicle markers were also concentrated. Formation of varicosities was frequently preceded or accompanied by highly dynamic filopodia-like membrane protrusions. Remarkably, HA-DAT often concentrated at the tips of these filopodia. This pool of HA-DATs exhibited low lateral membrane mobility. Thus, DAT-containing filopodia may be involved in synaptogenesis in developing DA neurons. Treatment of neurons with amphetamine increased mobility of filopodial HA-DAT and accelerated HA-DAT endocytosis in axons, suggesting that chronic amphetamine may interfere with DA synapse development.

Misfolded proteins are degraded primarily by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but the ubiquitin ligases responsible for the degradation remain largely unidentified. The cullin deneddylation activity of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) requires all 8 CSN subunits (CSN1 through CSN8) and regulates cullin-RING ligases, thereby controlling ubiquitination of a large number of proteins; however, neither CSN nor cullin-RING ligases is known to regulate the degradation of cytosolic misfolded proteins. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the role of CSN8/CSN in misfolded protein degradation and cardiac proteinopathy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac CSN8 knockout causes mouse premature death; hence, CSN8 hypomorphism (CSN8(hypo)) mice were used. Myocardial neddylated forms of cullins were markedly increased, and myocardial capacity of degrading a surrogate misfolded protein was significantly reduced by CSN8 hypomorphism. When introduced into proteinopathic mice in which a bona fide misfolded protein R120G missense mutation of alphabeta-crystallin (CryAB(R120G)) is overexpressed in the heart, CSN8 hypomorphism aggravated CryAB(R120G)-induced restrictive cardiomyopathy and shortened the lifespan of CryAB(R120G) mice, which was associated with augmented accumulation of protein aggregates, increased neddylated proteins, and reduced levels of total ubiquitinated proteins and LC3-II in the heart. In cultured cardiomyocytes, both CSN8 knockdown and cullin-RING ligase inactivation suppressed the ubiquitination and degradation of CryAB(R120G) but not native CryAB, resulting in accumulation of protein aggregates and exacerbation of CryAB(R120G) cytotoxicity.

We investigated the feasibility of an exon-skipping therapeutic approach by evaluating the splicing patterns and functional role of targeted exons. METHODS: Splicing of the targeted alpha2delta4 (CACNA2D4) exons in presence and absence of the mutation was assessed by RT-PCR in vivo on mouse retinae and in vitro in HEK293T cells using splicing-reporter minigenes. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed to evaluate the impact of different Cacna2d4 variants on the biophysical properties of Cav1.4 L-type calcium channels (CACNA1F). RESULTS: Splicing analysis revealed the presence of a previously unknown splicing isoform of alpha2delta4 in the retina that truncates the gene open reading frame (ORF) in a similar way as the c.2451insC mutation. This isoform originates from alternative splicing of exon 25 (E25) with a new exon (E25b). Moreover, the c.2451insC mutation has an effect on splicing and increases the proportion of transcripts including E25b. Our electrophysiological analyses showed that only full-length alpha2delta4 was able to increase Cav1.4/beta3-mediated currents while all other alpha2delta4 variants did not mediate such effect. CONCLUSIONS: The designed exon-skipping strategy is not applicable because the resulting skipped alpha2delta4 are nonfunctional. alpha2delta4 E25b splicing variant is normally present in mouse retina and mimics the effect of c.2451insC mutation.

A prerequisite to functionally dissect the complexity of the CRH/CRHR1 system is to unravel the identity of CRHR1-expressing neurons and their connectivities. Therefore, we used a knockin approach to genetically label CRHR1-expressing cells with a tau-lacZ (tZ) reporter gene. The distribution of neurons expressing beta-galactosidase in the brain and the relative intensity of labeling is in full accordance with previously described Crhr1 mRNA expression. Combining the microtubule-binding properties of TAU with the Cre-loxP system allowed to direct the beta-galactosidase to proximal dendrites, and in particular to axons. Thereby, we were able to visualize projections of CRHR1 neurons such as glutamatergic and dopaminergic afferent connections of the striatum and GABAergic CRHR1-expressing neurons located within its patch compartment. In addition, the tZ reporter gene revealed novel details of CRHR1 expression in the spinal cord, skin, and eye. CRHR1 expression in the retina prompted the identification of a new physiological role of CRHR1 related to the visual system. Besides its reporter properties, this novel CRHR1 allele comprises the possibility to conditionally restore or delete CRHR1 via Flp and Cre recombinase, respectively.

Casp2(-/-) osteoclasts are larger in size compared to wild-type osteoclasts and exhibited increased numbers of nuclei, perhaps due to increased precursor fusion. The loss of Casp-2 did not alter earlier stages of differentiation, but had a greater consequence on later stages involving NFATc1 auto-amplification and pre-osteoclast fusion. We have previously shown that the loss of Casp-2 results in increased oxidative stress in the bone. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is known to play a critical role in late osteoclast differentiation and we show that total ROS and specifically, mitochondrial ROS, significantly increased in Casp2(-/-) BMM precursors after RANKL administration, with a concomitant reduction in FoxO3a and its target antioxidant enzymes, catalase and superoxide 2 (SOD2). Because mitochondrial ROS has been identified as a putative regulator of the later stages of differentiation, the heightened ROS levels in Casp2(-/-) cells likely promote precursor fusion and increased osteoclast numbers. In conclusion, our results indicate a novel role of Casp-2 in the osteoclast as a modulator of total and mitochondrial ROS and osteoclast differentiation.", "publish_time": "2015-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 8, "macromolecule sequence": 10, "gel/blot": 1, "3D structure": 5, "other diagram": 8}}, "5638298": {"cord_uid": "5638298", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "A DAP12-Dependent signal promotes pro-inflammatory polarization in microglia following nerve injury and exacerbates degeneration of injured neurons.", "abstract": "Under pathological conditions, activated microglia play paradoxical roles and could have neurotoxic or neuroprotective effects.

Elevating Oct4 levels in explanted post-pluripotent cells in vitro restores their pluripotency. Cultured pluripotent cells can participate in normal development when introduced into host embryos up to the end of gastrulation. In contrast, pluripotent cells efficiently seed malignant teratocarcinomas in adult animals. In humans, extragonadal teratomas and teratocarcinomas are most frequently found in the sacrococcygeal region of neonates, suggesting that these tumours originate from cells in the posterior of the embryo that either reactivate or fail to switch off their pluripotent status. However, experimental models for the persistence or reactivation of pluripotency during embryonic development are lacking. METHODS: We manually injected embryonic stem cells into conceptuses at E9.5 to test whether the presence of pluripotent cells at this stage correlates with teratocarcinoma formation. We then examined the effects of reactivating embryonic Oct4 expression ubiquitously or in combination with Nanog within the primitive streak (PS)/tail bud (TB) using a transgenic mouse line and embryo chimeras carrying a PS/TB-specific heterologous gene expression cassette respectively. RESULTS: Here, we show that pluripotent cells seed teratomas in post-gastrulation embryos. However, at these stages, induced ubiquitous expression of Oct4 does not lead to restoration of pluripotency (indicated by Nanog expression) and tumour formation in utero, but instead causes a severe phenotype in the extending anteroposterior axis. Use of a more restricted T(Bra) promoter transgenic system enabling inducible ectopic expression of Oct4 and Nanog specifically in the posteriorly-located primitive streak (PS) and tail bud (TB) led to similar axial malformations to those induced by Oct4 alone. These cells underwent induction of pluripotency marker expression in Epiblast Stem Cell (EpiSC) explants derived from somitogenesis-stage embryos, but no teratocarcinoma formation was observed in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that although pluripotent cells with teratocarcinogenic potential can be produced in vitro by the overexpression of pluripotency regulators in explanted somitogenesis-stage somatic cells, the in vivo induction of these genes does not yield tumours.

Conditional mutants fail to form anterior brain structures and exhibit posterior body axis truncations, whereas initial blood vessel formation appears normal. Tetraploid rescue experiments reveal that lack of beta-catenin in the anterior visceral endoderm results in defects in head organizer formation.

The proneural gene Neurog2 is expressed in progenitors throughout corticogenesis, but is only required to specify early-born, deep-layer neuronal identities. Here, we examined how neuronal differentiation in general and Neurog2 function in particular are temporally controlled during murine neocortical development. We found that Neurog2 proneural activity declines in late corticogenesis, correlating with its phosphorylation by GSK3 kinase. Accordingly, GSK3 activity, which is negatively regulated by canonical Wnt signaling, increases over developmental time, while Wnt signaling correspondingly decreases. When ectopically activated, GSK3 inhibits Neurog2-mediated transcription in cultured cells and Neurog2 proneural activities in vivo. Conversely, a reduction in GSK3 activity promotes the precocious differentiation of later stage cortical progenitors without influencing laminar fate specification. Mechanistically, we show that GSK3 suppresses Neurog2 activity by influencing its choice of dimerization partner, promoting heterodimeric interactions with E47 (Tcfe2a), as opposed to Neurog2-Neurog2 homodimer formation, which occurs when GSK3 activity levels are low. At the functional level, Neurog2-E47 heterodimers have a reduced ability to transactivate neuronal differentiation genes compared with Neurog2-Neurog2 homodimers, both in vitro and in vivo.

Cortistatin is a multifunctional neuropeptide belonging to the somatostatin family that exerts unique functions in the nervous and immune systems. Cortistatin is elevated in plasma of patients experiencing coronary heart disease and attenuates vascular calcification. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence of vascular cortistatin and its effects on the proliferation and migration of SMCs in vitro and in vivo and to delimitate the receptors and signal transduction pathways governing its actions. METHODS AND RESULTS: SMCs from mouse carotid and human aortic arteries and from human atherosclerotic plaques highly expressed cortistatin. Cortistatin expression positively correlated with the progression of arterial intima hyperplasia. Cortistatin inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated proliferation of human aortic SMCs via binding to somatostatin receptors (sst2 and sst5) and ghrelin receptor, induction of cAMP and p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase, and inhibition of Akt activity. Moreover, cortistatin impaired lamellipodia formation and migration of human aortic SMCs toward platelet-derived growth factor by inhibiting, in a ghrelin-receptor-dependent manner, Rac1 activation and cytosolic calcium increases. These effects on SMC proliferation and migration correlated with an inhibitory action of cortistatin on the neointimal formation in 2 models of carotid arterial ligation. Endogenous cortistatin seems to play a critical role in regulating SMC function because cortistatin-deficient mice developed higher neointimal hyperplasic lesions than wild-type mice.

This is mitigated by regulatory mechanisms that develop over time and which minimize the inflammatory response to newly deposited eggs. Exploring changes in the hepatic inflammatory infiltrate over time in infected mice, we found an accumulation of schistosome egg antigen-specific IgG1-secreting plasma cells during chronic infection. This population was significantly diminished by blockade of the receptor for IL-10, a cytokine implicated in plasma cell development. Strikingly, IL-10R blockade precipitated the development of portal hypertension and the accumulation of parasite eggs in the lungs and heart. This did not reflect more aggressive Th2 cell responsiveness, increased hepatic fibrosis, or the emergence of Th1 or Th17 responses. Rather, a role for antibody in the prevention of severe disease was suggested by the finding that pulmonary involvement was also apparent in mice unable to secrete class switched antibody.

Heterozygous mutation in Foxi3 was identified in several hairless dog breeds characterized by sparse fur coat and missing teeth. A related phenotype called hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is caused by mutations in the ectodysplasin (Eda) pathway genes. RESULTS: Expression of Foxi3 was strictly confined to the epithelium in developing ectodermal appendages in mouse embryos, but no expression was detected in the epidermis. Foxi3 was expressed in teeth and hair follicles throughout embryogenesis, but in mammary glands only during the earliest stages of development. Foxi3 expression was decreased and increased in Eda loss- and gain-of-function embryos, respectively, and was highly induced by Eda protein in embryonic skin explants. Also activin A treatment up-regulated Foxi3 mRNA levels in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Eda and activin A were identified as upstream regulators of Foxi3. Foxi3 is a likely transcriptional target of Eda in ectodermal appendage placodes suggesting that HED phenotype may in part be produced by compromised Foxi3 activity.

Therefore, understanding the developmental regulatory networks that define a fully functional beta cell is important for elucidating the genetic origins of the disease. Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity has been associated with stem/progenitor cells and we have previously shown that Aldh1b1 is specifically expressed in pancreas progenitor pools. Here we address the hypothesis that Aldh1b1 may regulate the timing of the appearance and eventual functionality of beta cells. METHODS: We generated an Aldh1b1-knockout mouse line (Aldh1b1 (tm1lacZ)) and used this to study pancreatic development, beta cell functionality and glucose homeostasis in the absence of Aldh1b1 function. RESULTS: Differentiation in the developing pancreas of Aldh1b1 (tm1lacZ) null mice was accelerated. Transcriptome analyses of newborn and adult islets showed misregulation of key beta cell transcription factors and genes crucial for beta cell function. Functional analyses showed that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was severely compromised in islets isolated from null mice. Several key features of beta cell functionality were affected, including control of oxidative stress, glucose sensing, stimulus-coupling secretion and secretory granule biogenesis. As a result of beta cell dysfunction, homozygous mice developed glucose intolerance and age-dependent hyperglycaemia.

This phenotype is termed transmission ratio distortion (TRD) and is caused by the interaction of the t-complex responder (Tcr) with several quantitative trait loci (QTL), the t-complex distorters (Tcd1 to Tcd4), all located within the t-haplotype region. Current data suggest that the distorters collectively impair motility of all sperm derived from t/+ males; t-sperm is rescued by the responder, whereas (+)-sperm remains partially dysfunctional. Recently we have identified two distorters as regulators of RHO small G proteins. Here we show that the nucleoside diphosphate kinase gene Nme3 acts as a QTL on TRD. Reduction of the Nme3 dosage by gene targeting of the wild-type allele enhanced the transmission rate of the t-haplotype and phenocopied distorter function. Genetic and biochemical analysis showed that the t-allele of Nme3 harbors a mutation (P89S) that compromises enzymatic activity of the protein and genetically acts as a hypomorph. Transgenic overexpression of the Nme3 t-allele reduced t-haplotype transmission, proving it to be a distorter. We propose that the NME3 protein interacts with RHO signaling cascades to impair sperm motility through hyperactivation of SMOK, the wild-type form of the responder. This deleterious effect of the distorters is counter-balanced by the responder, SMOK(Tcr), a dominant-negative protein kinase exclusively expressed in t-sperm, thus permitting selfish behaviour and preferential transmission of the t-haplotype.

IKK/NF-kappaB blockade in the forebrain of mutant animals is associated with reduced levels of mature spines and postsynaptic proteins PSD95, SAP97, GluA1, AMPAR-mediated basal synaptic transmission and a spatial learning impairment.

Here we report the expression of QKI RNA-binding protein in the developing and mature mouse retina. QKI was strongly expressed by Muller glial cells in both the developing and adult retina. Intriguingly, during development, QKI was expressed in early differentiating neurons, such as the horizontal and amacrine cells, and subsequently in later differentiating bipolar cells, but not in photoreceptors.

To study the function of QKI in the mouse retina, we examined quakingviable(qkv) mice, which have a dysmyelination phenotype that results from deficiency of QKI expression and reduced numbers of mature oligodendrocytes. In homozygous qkv mutant mice (qkv/qkv), the optic nerve expression levels of QKI-6 and 7, but not QKI-5 were reduced. In the retina of the mutant homozygote, QKI-5 levels were unchanged, and QKI-6 and 7 levels, already low, were also unaffected. We conclude that QKI is expressed in developing and adult Muller glia. QKI is additionally expressed in progenitors and in differentiating neurons during retinal development, but expression weakened or diminished during maturation. Among QKI isoforms, we found that QKI-5 predominated in the adult mouse retina. Since Muller glial cells are thought to share properties with retinal progenitor cells, our data suggest that QKI may contribute to maintaining retinal progenitors prior to differentiation into neurons.

Therefore, Nrf2 activation is regarded as an effective strategy against oxidative stress-triggered cellular damage. In this study, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), a widely used Nrf2 activator, was initially employed to investigate the potential protective role of Nrf2 activation in SFA-induced hepatoxicity. As expected, SFA-induced hepatocyte cell death was prevented by tBHQ in both AML-12 mouse hepatocytes and HepG2 human hepatoma cells. However, the protective effect of tBHQ is Nrf2-independent, because the siRNA-mediated Nrf2 silencing did not abrogate tBHQ-conferred protection. Alternatively, our results revealed that autophagy activation was critically involved in the protective effect of tBHQ on lipotoxicity. tBHQ induced autophagy activation and autophagy inhibitors abolished tBHQ's protection. The induction of autophagy by tBHQ exposure was demonstrated by the increased accumulation of LC3 puncta, LC3-II conversion, and autophagic flux (LC3-II conversion in the presence of proteolysis inhibitors). Subsequent mechanistic investigation discovered that tBHQ exposure activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and siRNA-mediated AMPK gene silencing abolished tBHQ-induced autophagy activation, indicating that AMPK is critically involved in tBHQ-triggered autophagy induction. Furthermore, our study provided evidence that tBHQ-induced autophagy activation is required for its Nrf2-activating property.

FBXL10 is expressed as two isoforms: FBXL10-1, a longer form that contains an N-terminal histone demethylase domain with C-terminal F-box, CXXC, PHD, RING, and leucine-rich repeat domains, and FBXL10-2, a shorter form that initiates at an alternative internal exon and which lacks the histone demethylase domain but retains all other annotated domains. Selective deletion of Fbxl10-1 had been reported to produce a low penetrance and variable phenotype; most of the mutant animals were essentially normal. We constructed mutant mouse strains that were either null for Fbxl10-2 but wild type for Fbxl10-1 or null for both Fbxl10-1 and Fbxl10-2. RESULTS: Deletion of Fbxl10-2 (in a manner that does not perturb expression of Fbxl10-1) produced a phenotype very different from the Fbxl10-1 mutant, with craniofacial abnormalities, neural tube defects, and increased lethality, especially in females. Mutants that lacked both FBXL10-1 and FBXL10-2 showed embryonic lethality and even more extreme sexual dimorphism, with more severe gene dysregulation in mutant female embryos. X-linked genes were most severely dysregulated, and there was marked overexpression of Xist in mutant females although genes that encode factors that bind to Xist RNA were globally downregulated in mutant female as compared to male embryos. CONCLUSIONS: FBXL10 is the first factor shown to be required both for the normal expression and function of the Xist gene and for normal expression of proteins that associate with Xist RNA; it is proposed that FBXL10 coordinates the expression of Xist RNA with proteins that associate with this RNA.

Astrocytes are one of the principle cell types in the CNS and the stages associated with their development remain very poorly defined. To identify these stages, we performed gene-expression profiling on astrocyte precursor populations in the spinal cord, identifying distinct patterns of gene induction during their development that are strongly correlated with human astrocytes. Validation studies identified a new cohort of astrocyte-associated genes during development and demonstrated their expression in reactive astrocytes in human white matter injury (WMI). Functional studies on one of these genes revealed that mice lacking Asef exhibited impaired astrocyte differentiation during development and repair after WMI, coupled with compromised blood-brain barrier integrity in the adult CNS.

OBJECTIVE: To elucidate whether CaMKII phosphorylates titin and modulates F(passive) in normal and failing myocardium. METHODS AND RESULTS: Titin phosphorylation was assessed in CaMKIIdelta/gamma double-knockout (DKO) mouse, transgenic CaMKIIdeltaC-overexpressing mouse, and human hearts, by Pro-Q-Diamond/Sypro-Ruby staining, autoradiography, and immunoblotting using phosphoserine-specific titin-antibodies.

However, over the years, it became clear that the strain of mice can influence these results. Nevertheless, identical gene mutations in different strains are often still considered equals. An example of this, is the research done in phenylketonuria (PKU), an inheritable metabolic disorder. In this field, a PKU mouse model (either on a BTBR or C57Bl/6 background) is often used to examine underlying mechanisms of the disease and/or new treatment strategies. Both strains have a point mutation in the gene coding for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase which causes toxic concentrations of the amino acid phenylalanine in blood and brain, as found in PKU patients. Although the mutation is identical and therefore assumed to equally affect physiology and behavior in both strains, no studies directly compared the two genetic backgrounds to test this assumption. Therefore, this study compared the BTBR and C57Bl/6 wild-type and PKU mice on PKU-relevant amino acid- and neurotransmitter-levels and at a behavioral level. The behavioral paradigms were selected from previous literature on the PKU mouse model and address four domains, namely (1) activity levels, (2) motor performance, (3) anxiety and/or depression-like behavior, and (4) learning and memory. The results of this study showed comparable biochemical changes in phenylalanine and neurotransmitter concentrations. In contrast, clear differences in behavioral outcome between the strains in all four above-mentioned domains were found, most notably in the learning and memory domain. The outcome in this domain seem to be primarily due to factors inherent to the genetic background of the mouse and much less by differences in PKU-specific biochemical parameters in blood and brain. The difference in behavioral outcome between PKU of both strains emphasizes that the consequence of the PAH mutation is influenced by other factors than Phe levels alone.

We found that CTHRC1, a protein secreted by mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts, targets stromal cells to stimulate osteogenesis. Cthrc1 expression was robustly induced when mature osteoclasts were placed on dentin or hydroxyapatite, and also by increasing extracellular calcium. Cthrc1 expression in bone increased in a high-turnover state (such as that induced by RANKL injections in vivo), but decreased in conditions associated with suppressed bone turnover (such as with aging and after alendronate treatment).

A csgBA mutant, deficient in curli production, elicited decreased expression of interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and IL-22 in the cecal mucosa compared to the S. Typhimurium wild type.

Lower levels of IL-6 and IL-23 production were detected in the supernatants of the TLR2-deficient BMDCs treated with curli fibrils.

Herein we demonstrate a critical role for the homeodomain transcription factor ventral anterior homeobox 1 (VAX1) in GnRH neuron maturation and show thatVax1deletion from GnRH neurons leads to complete infertility in males and females. Specifically, globalVax1knock-out embryos had normal numbers of GnRH neurons at 13 d of gestation, but no GnRH staining was detected by embryonic day 17. To identify the role of VAX1 specifically in GnRH neuron development,Vax1(flox)mice were generated and lineage tracing performed inVax1(flox/flox):GnRH(cre):RosaLacZmice. This identified VAX1 as essential for maintaining expression ofGnrh1 The absence of GnRH staining in adultVax1(flox/flox):GnRH(cre)mice led to delayed puberty, hypogonadism, and infertility. To address the mechanism by which VAX1 maintainsGnrh1transcription, the capacity of VAX1 to regulateGnrh1transcription was evaluated in the GnRH cell lines GN11 and GT1-7. As determined by luciferase and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we found VAX1 to be a direct activator of the GnRH promoter through binding to four ATTA sites in the GnRH enhancer (E1) and proximal promoter (P), and able to compete with the homeoprotein SIX6 for occupation of the identified ATTA sites in the GnRH promoter. We conclude that VAX1 is expressed in GnRH neurons where it is required for GnRH neuron expression of GnRH and maintenance of fertility in mice.

We demonstrate that the guidance molecule Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) is initially secreted in the cortical plate of the embryonic marmoset monkey and acts as an intrinsic cue to control the migration of subpopulations of neuronal progenitors and projection neurons expressing the receptor Neuropilin 1 (Npn1). During the first 2 postnatal weeks, Sema3A expression becomes primarily associated with ventral visual cortical areas, leading to the specific migration of Npn1+ neurons in the late maturing visual areas. In the mouse, Sema3A distribution is not arealized, but Npn1 expression becomes restricted to the posterior neocortex at embryonic day 16.5. The selective reduction in the striate cortex we observe in Sema3A-/- animals potentially results from the differential distribution of Npn1+ cells.

We examined ATL1 functions by delivering its plasmids to the upper layer cortical neurons using in utero electroporation. The effects of ectopic expression in the pyramidal neurons were determined both in culture and in situ at postnatal stages of neocortical development. In cultured cortical neurons, overexpressing ATL1 increased dendrite growth and arborization, whereas HSP-associated mutant R217Q, which is devoid of GTPase activity, had no such effects.

We then devised an in vivo assay for stem cell replenishment and found that when challenged with repetitive rounds of regeneration, the Tbx1-deficient stem cell niche becomes progressively depleted.

Conditional inactivation of Ets2 in stromal fibroblasts in PyMT and ErbB2 driven tumors significantly reduced tumor growth, however deletion of Ets2 in epithelial cells in the PyMT model had no significant effect. Analysis of gene expression in fibroblasts revealed a tumor- and Ets2-dependent gene signature that was enriched in genes important for ECM remodeling, cell migration, and angiogenesis in both PyMT and ErbB2 driven-tumors. Consistent with these results, PyMT and ErbB2 tumors lacking Ets2 in fibroblasts had fewer functional blood vessels, and Ets2 in fibroblasts elicited changes in gene expression in tumor endothelial cells consistent with this phenotype. An in vivo angiogenesis assay revealed the ability of Ets2 in fibroblasts to promote blood vessel formation in the absence of tumor cells. Importantly, the Ets2-dependent gene expression signatures from both mouse models were able to distinguish human breast tumor stroma from normal stroma, and correlated with patient outcomes in two whole tumor breast cancer data sets.

Here, we show that beta-Catenin signaling regulates the differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells in the presence of the beta-Catenin interactor Homeodomain interacting protein kinase-1 gene (Hipk1). On one hand, Hipk1 is expressed at low levels during the entire embryonic forebrain development, allowing beta-Catenin to foster proliferation and to inhibit differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells. On the other hand, Hipk1 expression dramatically increases in neural stem/progenitor cells, residing within the subventricular zone (SVZ), at the time when the canonical Wnt signaling induces cell differentiation. Analysis of mouse brains electroporated with Hipk1, and the active form of beta-Catenin reveals that coexpression of both genes induces proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to escape the cell cycle. Moreover, in SVZ derive neurospheres cultures, the overexpression of both genes increases the expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor P16Ink4.

The role of the Wnt/frizzled pathway in vascular biology has recently been reported. The objectives of this study are to analyse the role of Frizzled7 (Fzd7) receptor in the control of vascular integrity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fzd7 is expressed in endothelial cells and accumulates at the points of cell-cell contact in association with VE-cadherin and beta-catenin, two major adherens junction molecules. To selectively delete fzd7 in the vasculature, we developed gene targeting approaches using CreLox strategy in mice. Genetic fzd7 inhibition in the endothelium increases vascular permeability in basal and factor-induced conditions. On the cellular level, fzd7 knockdown or depletion leads to an increase in paracellular permeability with a loss of adherens junction organization. These impairments are associated with a decrease in both VE-Cadherin and beta-catenin expression, a decrease in their association and an increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin/beta-catenin. Fzd7 transduces a Wnt/beta-catenin signalling cascade that is required to regulate beta-catenin and canonical target gene expression. Finally, LiCl, a GSK3 inhibitor, and beta-catenin overexpression rescued endothelial integrity and adherens junction organization, induced by fzd7 deletion.

In the embryonic telencephalon, the proneural genes Neurog1 and Neurog2 specify a dorsal regional identity and glutamatergic projection neuron phenotype in the presumptive neocortex, but their roles in cell fate specification in the olfactory bulb, which is also partly derived from dorsal telencephalic progenitors, have yet to be assessed. Given that olfactory bulb development is guided by interactions with the olfactory epithelium in the periphery, where proneural genes are also expressed, we investigated the roles of Neurog1 and Neurog2 in the coordinated development of these two olfactory structures. RESULTS: Neurog1/2 are co-expressed in olfactory bulb progenitors, while only Neurog1 is widely expressed in progenitors for olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium. Strikingly, only a remnant of an olfactory bulb forms in Neurog1-/-;Neurog2-/- double mutants, while this structure is smaller but distinguishable in Neurog1-/- single mutants and morphologically normal in Neurog2-/- single mutants. At the cellular level, fewer glutamatergic mitral and juxtaglomerular cells differentiate in Neurog1-/-;Neurog2-/- double-mutant olfactory bulbs. Instead, ectopic olfactory bulb interneurons are derived from dorsal telencephalic lineages in Neurog1-/-;Neurog2-/- double mutants and to a lesser extent in Neurog2-/- single mutants. Conversely, cell fate specification is normal in Neurog1-/- olfactory bulbs, but aberrant patterns of cell proliferation and neuronal migration are observed in Neurog1-/- single and Neurog1-/-;Neurog2-/- double mutants, probably contributing to their altered morphologies. Finally, in Neurog1-/- and Neurog1-/-;Neurog2-/- embryos, olfactory sensory neurons in the epithelium, which normally project to the olfactory bulb to guide its morphogenesis, fail to innervate the olfactory bulb. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a cell autonomous role for Neurog1/2 in specifying the glutamatergic identity of olfactory bulb neurons. Furthermore, Neurog1 (and not Neurog2) is required to guide olfactory sensory neuron innervation of the olfactory bulb, the loss of which results in defects in olfactory bulb proliferation and tissue morphogenesis.

COL7A1 secures the attachment of the epidermis to the dermis, and its mutations cause a human skin fragility disorder coined recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) that is associated with a constant wound burden. We show that COL7A1 is instrumental for skin wound closure by 2 interconnected mechanisms. First, COL7A1 was required for re-epithelialization through organization of laminin-332 at the dermal-epidermal junction. Its loss perturbs laminin-332 organization during wound healing, which in turn abrogates strictly polarized expression of integrin alpha6beta4 in basal keratinocytes and negatively impacts the laminin-332/integrin alpha6beta4 signaling axis guiding keratinocyte migration. Second, COL7A1 supported dermal fibroblast migration and regulates their cytokine production in the granulation tissue.

Within the central nervous system, two protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) target these regulatory tyrosines in Fyn. PTPalpha dephosphorylates Tyr(531) and activates Fyn, while STEP (STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase) dephosphorylates Tyr(420) and inactivates Fyn. Thus, PTPalpha and STEP have opposing functions in the regulation of Fyn; however, whether there is cross talk between these two PTPs remains unclear. Here, we used molecular techniques in primary neuronal cultures and in vivo to demonstrate that STEP negatively regulates PTPalpha by directly dephosphorylating PTPalpha at its regulatory Tyr(789). Dephosphorylation of Tyr(789) prevents the translocation of PTPalpha to synaptic membranes, blocking its ability to interact with and activate Fyn. Genetic or pharmacologic reduction in STEP61 activity increased the phosphorylation of PTPalpha at Tyr(789), as well as increased translocation of PTPalpha to synaptic membranes. Activation of PTPalpha and Fyn and trafficking of GluN2B to synaptic membranes are necessary for ethanol (EtOH) intake behaviors in rodents. We tested the functional significance of STEP61 in this signaling pathway by EtOH administration to primary cultures as well as in vivo, and demonstrated that the inactivation of STEP61 by EtOH leads to the activation of PTPalpha, its translocation to synaptic membranes, and the activation of Fyn. These findings indicate a novel mechanism by which STEP61 regulates PTPalpha and suggest that STEP and PTPalpha coordinate the regulation of Fyn. STEP61 , PTPalpha, Fyn, and NMDA receptor (NMDAR) have been implicated in ethanol intake behaviors in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) in rodents. Here, we report that PTPalpha is a novel substrate for STEP61. Upon ethanol exposure, STEP61 is phosphorylated and inactivated by protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in the DMS. As a result of STEP61 inhibition, there is an increase in the phosphorylation of PTPalpha, which translocates to lipid rafts and activates Fyn and subsequent NMDAR signaling. The results demonstrate a synergistic regulation of Fyn-NMDAR signaling by STEP61 and PTPalpha, which may contribute to the regulation of ethanol-related behaviors.

We used comparative proteomics analysis of Fbln4(SMKO) aortas from postnatal day (P) 1 to P30 mice to identify key molecules involved in aneurysm initiation and expansion. At P14, the actin depolymerizing factor cofilin was dephosphorylated and thus activated, and at P7, the abundance of slingshot-1 (SSH1) phosphatase, an activator of cofilin, was increased, leading to actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Also, by P7, biomechanical changes and underdeveloped elastic lamina-SMC connections were evident, and the abundance of early growth response 1 (Egr1), a mechanosensitive transcription factor that stimulates ACE expression, was increased, which was before the increases in ACE abundance and cofilin activation. Postnatal deletion of Fbln4 in SMCs at P7 prevented cofilin activation and aneurysm formation, suggesting that these processes required disruption of elastic lamina-SMC connections. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is involved in the angiotensin II-mediated activation of SSH1, and administration of PI3K inhibitors from P7 to P30 decreased SSH1 abundance and prevented aneurysms.

Similar to cell death, neuronal development was delayed in Pex11beta(+/-) mice, and to a further extent in Pex11beta(-/-) mice, as measured by a reduced mRNA and protein level of synaptophysin and a reduced protein level of the mature isoform of MAP2.

Fyn oxidation was increased in mouse skin after SSL exposure and Fyn-knockout mice formed larger and more tumors compared with Fyn wild-type mice when exposed to SSL for an extended period of time. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking Fyn and cells in which Fyn expression was knocked down were resistant to SSL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, cells expressing mutant Fyn (C448A) were resistant to SSL-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that Fyn acts as a regulatory nexus between solar UV, ROS and signal transduction during skin carcinogenesis.Oncogene advance online publication, 21 December 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.471.", "publish_time": "2015-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 12, "macromolecule sequence": 15, "gel/blot": 1, "3D structure": 1, "fluorescence": 1}}, "5906967": {"cord_uid": "5906967", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Directed transport of neutrophil-derived extracellular vesicles enables platelet-mediated innate immune response.", "abstract": "The innate immune response to bacterial infections requires the interaction of neutrophils and platelets.

Activated platelets adhere to intravascular neutrophils through P-selectin/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1)-mediated binding, a primary interaction that allows platelets glycoprotein Ibalpha (GPIbalpha)-induced generation of neutrophil-derived extracellular vesicles (EV). EV production is directed by exocytosis and allows shuttling of arachidonic acid into platelets. EVs are then specifically internalized into platelets in a Mac1-dependent fashion, and relocated into intracellular compartments enriched in cyclooxygenase1 (Cox1), an enzyme processing arachidonic acid to synthesize thromboxane A2 (TxA2). Finally, platelet-derived-TxA2 elicits a full neutrophil response by inducing the endothelial expression of ICAM-1, intravascular crawling, and extravasation.

Here, we demonstrate that XX fetal gonads contain GATA4 expressing supporting cells that either enter mitotic arrest, or remain proliferative.

As in other organisms, the timekeeping mechanism in mammals depends on a self-sustaining transcriptional negative feedback loop with a built-in time delay in feedback inhibition. Although the time delay is essential for generating a slow, self-sustaining negative feedback loop with a period close to 24 hr, the exact mechanisms underlying the time delay are not known. RESULTS: Here, we show that RNAi mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs) is an essential mechanism in generating the time delay. In Dicer-deficient (and thus miRNA-deficient) cells and mice, circadian rhythms were dramatically shortened (by approximately 2 hr), although the rhythms remained robust. The period shortening was caused by faster PER1 and PER2 translation in the Dicer-deficient cells. We also identified three specific miRNAs that regulate Per expression and showed that knockdown of these miRNAs in wild-type cells also shortened the circadian period. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the canonical function of miRNAs as translational modulators of target genes and their widespread roles in cell physiology, circadian rhythms are also modulated by miRNA-mediated RNAi acting on posttranscriptional regulation of key clock genes. Our present study definitively shows that RNAi is an important modulator of circadian rhythms by controlling the pace of PER synthesis and presents a novel layer of regulation for the clock.", "publish_time": "2013-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 7, "3D structure": 10, "macromolecule sequence": 7, "gel/blot": 3, "light microscopy": 4, "other diagram": 1}}, "5445439": {"cord_uid": "5445439", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Neurofibromatosis-1 heterozygosity impairs CNS neuronal morphology in a cAMP/PKA/ROCK-dependent manner.", "abstract": "Children with the neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome exhibit numerous clinical problems that reflect defective central nervous system (CNS) neuronal function, including learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, and seizures. These clinical features result from reduced NF1 protein (neurofibromin) expression in NF1+/- (NF1 heterozygosity) brain neurons. Previous studies have shown that mouse CNS neurons are sensitive to the effects of reduced Nf1 expression and exhibit shorter neurite lengths, smaller growth cone areas, and attenuated survival, reflecting attenuated neurofibromin cAMP regulation. In striking contrast, Nf1+/- peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons are nearly indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts, and complete neurofibromin loss leads to increased neurite lengths and survival in a RAS/Akt-dependent fashion. To gain insights into the differential responses of CNS and PNS neurons to reduced neurofibromin function, we designed a series of experiments to define the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the unique CNS neuronal sensitivity to Nf1 heterozygosity. First, Nf1 heterozygosity decreases cAMP levels in CNS, but not in PNS, neurons. Second, CNS neurons exhibit Nf1 gene-dependent increases in RAS pathway signaling, but no further decreases in cAMP levels were observed in Nf1-/- CNS neurons relative to their Nf1+/- counterparts. Third, neurofibromin regulates CNS neurite length and growth cone areas in a cAMP/PKA/Rho/ROCK-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo.

Myocardial oxygen consumption is determined by regulation of energy metabolism, which shifts from glycolysis to lipid oxidation soon after birth, and is reversed in failing adult hearts, accompanying re-expression of several \"fetal\" genes whose role in disease phenotypes remains unknown. Here we show that hypoxia-controlled expression of the transcription factor Hand1 determines oxygen consumption by inhibition of lipid metabolism in the fetal and adult cardiomyocyte, leading to downregulation of mitochondrial energy generation. Hand1 is under direct transcriptional control by HIF1alpha. Transgenic mice prolonging cardiac Hand1 expression die immediately following birth, failing to activate the neonatal lipid metabolising gene expression programme. Deletion of Hand1 in embryonic cardiomyocytes results in premature expression of these genes. Using metabolic flux analysis, we show that Hand1 expression controls cardiomyocyte oxygen consumption by direct transcriptional repression of lipid metabolising genes. This leads, in turn, to increased production of lactate from glucose, decreased lipid oxidation, reduced inner mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial ATP generation. We found that this pathway is active in adult cardiomyocytes. Up-regulation of Hand1 is protective in a mouse model of myocardial ischaemia.

We conclude that beta-catenin has multiple functions during thalamic neurogenesis and that both Shh and beta-catenin pathways are important for specifying distinct types of thalamic progenitor cells, ensuring that the appropriate neuronal subtypes are generated in the correct locations.", "publish_time": "2012-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"residual": 1, "other diagram": 42, "histogram": 5, "gel/blot": 4, "fluorescence": 9, "macromolecule sequence": 1}}, "5699917": {"cord_uid": "5699917", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Human Polycystin-2 Transgene Dose-Dependently Rescues ADPKD Phenotypes in Pkd2 Mutant Mice.", "abstract": "Although much is known about the molecular genetic mechanisms of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), few effective treatment is currently available.

Wild-type mice with human PKD2 transgene (PKD2(tg)) overexpressed polycystin (PC)-2 in several tissues, including the kidney and liver, and showed no significant cyst formation in either organ. We cross-mated PKD2(tg) with a Pkd2-null mouse model, which is embryonically lethal and forms renal and pancreatic cysts. Pkd2(-/-) mice with human PKD2 transgene (Pkd2(-/-);PKD2(tg)) were born in expected Mendelian ratios, indicating that the embryonic lethality of the Pkd2(-/-) mice was rescued.

Nearly half the POFUT2 targets belong to the A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin type-1 motifs (ADAMTS) or ADAMTS-like family of proteins. Both the mouse Pofut2 RST434 gene trap allele and the Adamts9 knockout were reported to result in early embryonic lethality, suggesting that defects in Pofut2 mutant embryos could result from loss of O-fucosylation on ADAMTS9. To address this question, we compared the Pofut2 and Adamts9 knockout phenotypes and used Cre-mediated deletion of Pofut2 and Adamts9 to dissect the tissue-specific role of O-fucosylated ADAMTS9 during gastrulation. Disruption of Pofut2 using the knockout (LoxP) or gene trap (RST434) allele, as well as deletion of Adamts9, resulted in disorganized epithelia (epiblast, extraembryonic ectoderm, and visceral endoderm) and blocked mesoderm formation during gastrulation. The similarity between Pofut2 and Adamts9 mutants suggested that disruption of ADAMTS9 function could be responsible for the gastrulation defects observed in Pofut2 mutants. Consistent with this prediction, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of POFUT2 in HEK293T cells blocked secretion of ADAMTS9. We determined that Adamts9 was dynamically expressed during mouse gastrulation by trophoblast giant cells, parietal endoderm, the most proximal visceral endoderm adjacent to the ectoplacental cone, extraembryonic mesoderm, and anterior primitive streak. Conditional deletion of either Pofut2 or Adamts9 in the epiblast rescues the gastrulation defects, and identified a new role for O-fucosylated ADAMTS9 during morphogenesis of the amnion and axial mesendoderm. Combined, these results suggested that loss of ADAMTS9 function in the extra embryonic tissue is responsible for gastrulation defects in the Pofut2 knockout. We hypothesize that loss of ADAMTS9 function in the most proximal visceral endoderm leads to slippage of the visceral endoderm and altered characteristics of the extraembryonic ectoderm. Consequently, loss of input from the extraembryonic ectoderm and/or compression of the epiblast by Reichert's membrane blocks gastrulation.

Hence, the generation of genetic tools based on Pet1 specific expression represents a valuable approach to study the development and function of the serotonergic system. Here, we report the generation of a Pet1(210)-Cre transgenic mouse line in which the Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of a 210 kb fragment from the Pet1 genetic locus to ensure a reliable and faithful control of somatic recombination in Pet1 cell lineage.

Acute hyperglycemia induced by dextrose ingestion does not restore their retinal function, which is consistent with irreversible loss of vision. The goal of this study was to establish whether long-term administration of high dietary glucose rescues retinal function and circuit connectivity in aged Gcgr-/- mice. METHODS: Gcgr-/- mice were administered a carbohydrate-rich diet starting at 12 months of age. After 1 month of treatment, retinal function and structure were evaluated using electroretinographic (ERG) recordings and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Treatment with a carbohydrate-rich diet raised blood glucose levels and improved retinal function in Gcgr-/- mice. Blood glucose increased from moderate hypoglycemia to euglycemic levels, whereas ERG b-wave sensitivity improved approximately 10-fold. Because the b-wave reflects the electrical activity of second-order cells, we examined for changes in rod-to-bipolar cell synapses. Gcgr-/- retinas have 20% fewer synaptic pairings than Gcgr+/- retinas. Remarkably, most of the lost synapses were located farthest from the bipolar cell body, near the distal boundary of the outer plexiform layer (OPL), suggesting that apical synapses are most vulnerable to chronic hypoglycemia.

While both GATA4 and GATA6 are expressed in an A-P gradient in the forelimb buds, the hindlimb buds principally express GATA6 in an A-P gradient. Thus, to specifically examine the role of GATA6 in limb patterning we generated Prx1-Cre; GATA6(fl/fl) mice, which conditionally delete GATA6 from their developing limb buds. We found that these animals display ectopic expression of both Shh and its transcriptional targets specifically in the anterior mesenchyme of the hindlimb buds. Loss of GATA6 in the developing limbs results in the formation of preaxial polydactyly in the hindlimbs. Conversely, forced expression of GATA6 throughout the limb bud represses expression of Shh and results in hypomorphic limbs. We have found that GATA6 can bind to chromatin (isolated from limb buds) encoding either Shh or Gli1 regulatory elements that drive expression of these genes in this tissue, and demonstrated that GATA6 works synergistically with FOG co-factors to repress expression of luciferase reporters driven by these sequences. Most significantly, we have found that conditional loss of Shh in limb buds lacking GATA6 prevents development of hindlimb polydactyly in these compound mutant embryos, indicating that GATA6 expression in the anterior region of the limb bud blocks hindlimb polydactyly by repressing ectopic expression of Shh.", "publish_time": "2014-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"compound": 1, "residual": 7, "line chart": 6, "fluorescence": 2, "gel/blot": 5, "macromolecule sequence": 7}}, "5766565": {"cord_uid": "5766565", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Severe Hypomyelination and Developmental Defects Are Caused in Mice Lacking Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) in the Central Nervous System.", "abstract": "Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is involved in cell proliferation, DNA damage response, and transcriptional regulation.

The suppressive nature of vaccine-elicited monocytes was confirmed using in vitro cocultures of murine monocytes and T cells. Furthermore, it was determined that inflammatory monocytes suppressed T cell responses by sequestering cysteine, as cysteine supplementation in vitro and in vivo appreciably augmented vaccine responses.

Keratinocyte nuclear degradation is not well characterised, and it is unclear whether the retained nuclei contribute to the altered epidermal differentiation seen in eczema and psoriasis. Loss of AKT1 function strongly correlated with parakeratosis both in eczema samples and in organotypic culture models. Although levels of DNAses, including DNase1L2, were unchanged, proteomic analysis revealed an increase in Lamin A/C. AKT phosphorylates Lamin A/C, targeting it for degradation. Consistent with this, Lamin A/C degradation was inhibited and Lamin A/C was observed in the cornified layer of AKT1 knockdown organotypic cultures, surrounding retained nuclear material. Using AKT-phosphorylation-dead Lamin A constructs we show that the retention of nuclear material is sufficient to cause profound changes in epidermal terminal differentiation, specifically a reduction in Loricrin, Keratin 1, Keratin 10, and filaggrin expression. We show that preventing nuclear degradation upregulates BMP2 expression and SMAD1 signalling.

Anti-TWEAK treatment did not affect the generation of mouse anti-rabbit antibodies; however, within the kidney there was a significant decrease in glomerular immunoglobulin deposition, as well as macrophage infiltrates and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.

Recent findings point to a co-ordinated interplay between intracellular Ca(2+) cycling and plasma membrane-localized cation transport determining the origin and periodicity of pacemaker potentials. The sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX1) is a key sarcolemmal protein for the maintenance of calcium homeostasis in the heart. Here, we investigated the contribution of NCX1 to cardiac pacemaking. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used an inducible and sinoatrial node-specific Cre transgene to create micelacking NCX1 selectively in cells of the cardiac pacemaking and conduction system (cpNCX1KO). RT-PCR and immunolabeling experiments confirmed the precise tissue-specific and temporally controlled deletion. Ablation of NCX1 resulted in a progressive slowing of heart rate accompanied by severe arrhythmias. Isolated sinoatrial tissue strips displayed a significantly decreased and irregular contraction rate underpinning a disturbed intrinsic pacemaker activity. Mutant animals displayed a gradual increase in the heart-to-body weight ratio and developed ventricular dilatation; however, their ventricular contractile performance was not significantly affected. Pacemaker cells from cpNCX1KO showed no NCX1 activity in response to caffeine-induced Ca(2+) release, determined by Ca(2+) imaging. Regular spontaneous Ca(2+) discharges were frequently seen in control, but only sporadically in knockout (KO) cells. The majority of NCX1KO cells displayed an irregular and a significantly reduced frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) signals. Furthermore, Ca(2+) transients measured during electrical field stimulation were of smaller magnitude and decelerated kinetics in KO cells.

Using aged mice, we developed a mouse model of ADT-induced sarcopenia that closely resembles the phenotype seen in patients, including loss of skeletal muscle strength, reduced lean muscle mass, and increased adipose tissue.

Western blot analysis showed that hypoxia reduced SERCA2 concomitantly with a sustained increase in LRP1 and pPyk2 protein levels in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. By impairing hypoxia-induced Pyk2 phosphorylation and HIF-1alpha accumulation, LRP1 deficiency prevented SERCA2 depletion and reduction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium content in cardiomyocytes.

During branching morphogenesis, SOX9 transcription factor is normally restricted from conducting airway epithelial cells and is highly expressed in peripheral, acinar progenitor cells that serve as precursors of alveolar type 2 (AT2) and AT1 cells as the lung matures.

Activation of beta-catenin enhanced SOX9 expression in peripheral epithelial progenitors, whereas deletion of beta-catenin inhibited SOX9. Surprisingly, deletion of beta-catenin caused accumulation of atypical SOX9-positive basal cells in conducting airways. Inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by Kras(G12D) or its downstream target Foxm1 stimulated SOX9 expression in basal cells.

CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between the Wnt/beta-catenin and the Kras/ERK/Foxm1 pathways are essential to restrict SOX9 expression in basal cells. Developmental Dynamics 245:590-604, 2016.

We recently showed that FABP4 regulates triglyceride accumulation in primary human trophoblasts. To assess the function of placental FABP4 in vivo, we tested the hypothesis that FABP4 is expressed in the murine placenta, and regulates placenta triglyceride accumulation. METHODS: C57Bl/6 wild type or Fabp4-null mice were time-bred, and fetuses and placentas harvested at different time points during pregnancy. Placental FABP4 expression was assessed at different gestational ages, using quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and western immunoblotting. FABPs expression was examined by RT-qPCR. Placental lipids were extracted using the Folch method and triglyceride levels determined using a colorimetric quantification kit. RESULTS: Using immunohistochemistry, we found that FABP4 was expressed in the placental labyrinthine layer, predominantly in endothelial cells in association with CD31 positive fetal capillaries. The level of placental FABP4 mRNA and protein increased from E12.5 to E16.5 and slightly decreased at E18.5. Breeding of Fabp4 heterozygous mice resulted in embryonic genotypes that followed a Mendelian distribution and exhibited normal weight and morphology, triglyceride content, and expression of other FABP family members. Exposure to hypoxia (O2 = 12%) between E12.5-E18.5 did not uncover a difference between wild type and Fabp4-null mice.

Here, we show that bone marrow-derived MSCs expressing a constitutively active AKT1 expand HSCs, but severely affect their functionality. Conversely, stromal cells with silenced AKT1 limit HSC proliferation, but boost their functionality. These effects were related to differential modulation of several important regulatory genes, in both, the cocultured HSCs and in the stromal cells themselves. The detrimental effect of stromal cells with constitutively activated AKT1 involved dynamin-dependent endocytosis, whereas the salutary effect of stromal cells devoid of AKT1 was mediated via GAP junctions. Constitutive activation of AKT1 led to deregulated formation of GAP junctions in the stromal cells, which consequently exhibited strikingly increased intercellular transfer of molecular cargo to the HSCs. Conversely, stromal cells with silenced AKT1 exhibited normal intercellular arrangement of GAP junctions at appositional membrane areas, and did not show aberrant intercellular transfer. Micro-vesicles isolated from conditioned media of the stromal cells not only mimicked the effect of these cells, but also showed stronger effects. This is perhaps the first report demonstrating that AKT1 signaling prevailing in the MSCs regulates HSC functionality through various intercellular communication mechanisms.

Injured epithelial cells lose their properties and gain mesenchymal characteristics, a phenotypic switch that contributes to lung remodelling after injury. Here we studied bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling and, in particular, the role of BMP2 and the BMP modulator BMPER in injured lung epithelium. Increased BMP activity, reflected by up-regulation of the Smad1/5-Id1 axis, is detected after injury of lung epithelium in vitro and in vivo. Two members of the BMP family, BMP2 and BMPER, have opposing effects. BMP2 is up-regulated after epithelial injury and causes epithelial dysfunction and hyperpermeability, mediated by the Smad1/5-Id1-dependent down-regulation of E-cadherin. In contrast, BMPER expression is decreased following injury, which in turn impairs epithelial integrity, characterized by reduction of E-cadherin and epithelial leakage in vitro and in vivo. High levels of BMPER antagonized BMP2-Smad5-Id1 signalling and prevented BMP2-mediated decrease of E-cadherin and hyperpermeability, suggesting that BMPER restores epithelial homeostasis. Supporting this notion, pharmacological inhibition of BMP signalling by LDN193189 prevented reduction of E-cadherin and disruption of epithelial barrier function. Inhibition of excessive BMP activation could be a new approach to restore epithelial integrity and prevent disruption of epithelial barrier function after lung injury.

METHODS: The corneal epithelium was scraped and LPS was applied to u-PA wild-type (u-PA(+/+)) and u-PA-deficient (u-PA(-/-)) mice. Corneal re-epithelialization and opacity were measured by stereomicroscopy. Fibrin zymography was performed to detect plasminogen activators in corneas from u-PA(+/+) and u-PA(-/-) mice.

Gene expression of corneal macrophage chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 was assessed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The in vitro effects of endogenous u-PA on MCP-1, MIP-2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 expression, and macrophage migration activity in mouse ocular fibroblasts stimulated by LPS, were examined. RESULTS: The u-PA(+/+) mice showed enhanced corneal inflammation as compared with u-PA(-/-) mice. The u-PA expression was increased by LPS stimulation.

Since its expression is lost in several cancer types, Dab2 has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor. In vitro studies indicate that Dab2 establishes epithelial cell polarity and organization by directing endocytic trafficking of membrane glycoproteins. Dab2 also modulates cellular signaling pathways by mediating the endocytosis and recycling of surface receptors and associated signaling components. Previously, two independent gene knockout studies have been reported, with some discrepancies in the observed embryonic phenotypes. To further clarify the in vivo roles of Dab2 in development and physiology, we designed a new floxed allele to delete dab2 gene. RESULTS: The constitutive dab2 deleted embryos showed a spectrum in the degree of endoderm disorganization in E5.5 and no mutant embryos persisted at E9.5. However, the mice were grossly normal when dab2 deletion was restricted to the embryo proper and the gene was retained in extraembryonic tissues using Meox2-Cre and Sox2-Cre. Adult Dab2-deficient mice had a small but statistically significant increase in serum cholesterol levels. CONCLUSION: The study of the new dab2 mutant allele in embryos and embryoid bodies confirms a role for Dab2 in extraembryonic endoderm development and epithelial organization. Experimental results with embryoid bodies suggest that additional endocytic adaptors such as Arh and Numb could partially compensate for Dab2 loss. Conditional deletion indicates that Dab2 is dispensable for organ development, when the vast majority of the embryonic cells are dab2 null.

Accordingly, downregulation of endogenous XIAP protein levels strongly increases neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells as well as axonal and dendritic length in primary cortical neurons.

These partners have coevolved with the acquisition of the permanent encapsidation of the entire genome by the nucleoprotein (N) and the use of this N-RNA complex as a template for the viral polymerase composed of the phosphoprotein (P) and the large enzymatic protein (L). Not only is P required for polymerase function, but it also stabilizes the L protein through an unknown underlying molecular mechanism. By using NVP-AUY922 and/or 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin as specific inhibitors of cellular heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), we found that efficient chaperoning of L by HSP90 requires P in the measles, Nipah, and vesicular stomatitis viruses. While the production of P remains unchanged in the presence of HSP90 inhibitors, the production of soluble and functional L requires both P and HSP90 activity. Measles virus P can bind the N terminus of L in the absence of HSP90 activity. Both HSP90 and P are required for the folding of L, as evidenced by a luciferase reporter insert fused within measles virus L. HSP90 acts as a true chaperon; its activity is transient and dispensable for the activity of measles and Nipah virus polymerases of virion origin. That the cellular chaperoning of a viral polymerase into a soluble functional enzyme requires the assistance of another viral protein constitutes a new paradigm that seems to be conserved within the Mononegavirales order. IMPORTANCE: Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that require a cellular environment for their replication. Some viruses particularly depend on the cellular chaperoning apparatus. We report here that for measles virus, successful chaperoning of the viral L polymerase mediated by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) requires the presence of the viral phosphoprotein (P). Indeed, while P protein binds to the N terminus of L independently of HSP90 activity, both HSP90 and P are required to produce stable, soluble, folded, and functional L proteins.

Averting apoptosis in AIF-deficient mice decreased apoptosis of leukocytes and endothelial cells compared to wild-type mice and resulted in the persistence of these cells at angiogenic sites in vitro and in vivo.

Due to the imperative role of FGF signalling during the development of other branched structures, we investigated the role of Fgf10 during initiation and branching morphogenesis of murine nasal SMGs. Fgf10 is expressed in the mesenchyme around developing SMGs while expression of its receptor Fgfr2 is seen within glandular epithelial cells. In the Fgf10 null embryo, Steno's gland and the maxillary sinus gland were completely absent while other neighbouring nasal glands showed normal duct elongation but defective branching. Interestingly, the medial nasal glands were present in Fgf10 homozygotes but missing in Fgfr2b mutants, with expression of Fgf7 specifically expressed around these developing glands, indicating that Fgf7 might compensate for loss of Fgf10 in this group of glands. Intriguingly the lateral nasal glands were only mildly affected by loss of FGF signalling, while these glands were missing in Eda mutant mice, where the Steno's and maxillary sinus gland developed as normal. This analysis reveals that regulation of nasal gland development is complex with different subsets of glands being regulated by different signalling pathways.

Here, we have investigated the specific tissue, cell type and developmental regulation of expression mediated by the Atp1a4 promoter. METHODS: We have inserted the green fluorescent protein (GFP), downstream of the endogenous Atp1a4 promoter, in place of the Na,K-ATPase alpha4 gene, and used it as a marker for alpha4 expression in mice (Atp1a4 ( null(GFP) ) mice). RESULTS: Replacement of alpha4 by GFP completely disrupted alpha4 expression and activity, produced sperm morphological and functional abnormalities, and caused infertility of Atp1a4 ( null(GFP) ) male mice. Immunoblot analysis of Atp1a4 ( null(GFP) ) mouse tissues showed GFP expression in testis. This particular expression pattern was found in adult, but not in mouse embryos or in 7, 18 day old mice. In agreement with expression of GFP, adult Atp1a4 ( null(GFP) ) mouse testis displayed the typical fluorescence of GFP. Immunocytochemistry of testis identified GFP in more differentiated male germ cells, but not in spermatogonia, Leydig or Sertoli cells. Further analysis, using immunoblot of fluorescently sorted testis cells with cell specific markers, detected GFP only in spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa. While epididymis showed GFP expression, this was confined to the spermatozoa within the epididymal tubules.

Recent studies have revealed that Hedgehog signaling opposes HC differentiation and is critical for the establishment of the graded pattern of auditory HC differentiation. However, how Hedgehog signaling interferes with HC differentiation is unknown. Here, we provide evidence that in the murine cochlea, Hey1 and Hey2 control the spatiotemporal pattern of HC differentiation downstream of Hedgehog signaling. It has been recently shown that HEY1 and HEY2, two highly redundant HES-related transcriptional repressors, are highly expressed in supporting cell (SC) and HC progenitors (prosensory cells), but their prosensory function remained untested. Using a conditional double knock-out strategy, we demonstrate that prosensory cells form and proliferate properly in the absence of Hey1 and Hey2 but differentiate prematurely because of precocious upregulation of the pro-HC factor Atoh1. Moreover, we demonstrate that prosensory-specific expression of Hey1 and Hey2 and its subsequent graded downregulation is controlled by Hedgehog signaling in a largely FGFR-dependent manner. In summary, our study reveals a critical role for Hey1 and Hey2 in prosensory cell maintenance and identifies Hedgehog signaling as a novel upstream regulator of their prosensory function in the mammalian cochlea.

Pyruvate is an energy substrate associated with neuroprotective properties. In this study, we evaluated protective effects of long-term administration of pyruvate in 3xTg-AD mice, a preclinical AD model that develops amyloid-beta- and tau-dependent pathology. Chronic (9months) treatment with pyruvate inhibited short and long-term memory deficits in 6 and 12months old 3xTg-AD mice as assessed with the Morris water maze test. Pyruvate had no effects on intraneuronal amyloid-beta accumulation and, surprisingly, the molecule increased deposition of phosphorylated tau. Pyruvate did not change aerobic or anaerobic metabolisms but decreased lipid peroxidation, counteracted neuronal hyperexcitability, decreased baseline levels of oxidative stress, and also reduced reactive oxygen species-driven elevations of intraneuronal Zn(2+) as well as glutamate receptor-mediated deregulation of intraneuronal Ca(2+). Thus, pyruvate promotes beneficial cognitive effects without affecting Abeta and tau pathology.

How NHE1 is activated by decreased cell volume is not generally well understood. Full activation of NHE1 by decreased cell volume in 2-cell mouse embryos required the activity of the tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 (Jak2), since NHE1 activation was inhibited by the general tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, several selective inhibitors of Jak2, and dominant negative Jak2 expressed in 2-cell embryos. Decreased cell volume furthermore resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in 2-cell embryos detected both by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and an antibody directed against active phospho-Jak2.

Here we find that the six nsP1 nonsynonymous nucleotide differences between strains T48 and DC5692 are determinants of RRV virulence, and we identify two nonsynonymous nucleotide changes as sufficient for the attenuated phenotype. RRV T48 carrying the six nonsynonymous DC5692 nucleotide differences (RRV-T48-nsP1(6M)) was attenuated in both wild-type and Rag1(-/-) mice.

Here, we used a murine cataract surgery model to investigate the role of the Zeb proteins, Smad interacting protein 1 (Sip1) and delta-crystallin enhancer-binding factor 1 (deltaEF1), during PCO.

Recent studies have implicated mTOR signaling in the stress response, but its connection to eIF2alphaS51P has remained unclear.

On the other hand, the allosteric inhibitor rapamycin induces eIF2alphaS51P through pathways that are independent of mTORC1 inactivation. Increased eIF2alphaS51P by impaired mTORC2 depends on the inactivation of AKT, which primes the activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident kinase PERK/PEK. The biologic function of eIF2alphaS51P was characterized in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-mutant cells, which are defective in mTORC2 and AKT activity. TSC-mutant cells exhibit increased PERK activity, which is downregulated by the reconstitution of the cells with an activated form of AKT1. Also, TSC-mutant cells are increasingly susceptible to ER stress, which is reversed by AKT1 reconstitution. The susceptibility of TSC-mutant cells to ER stress is further enhanced by the pharmacologic inhibition of PERK or genetic inactivation of eIF2alphaS51P. Thus, the PERK/eIF2alphaS51P arm is an important compensatory prosurvival mechanism, which substitutes for the loss of AKT under ER stress.

We sought to assess the role of connexin 43 (Cx43) as a mediator of CNS inflammation and chronic pain. To determine the extent of Cx43 involvement in chronic pain, a weight-drop SCI was performed on transgenic mice with Cx43/Cx30 deletions. SCI induced robust and persistent neuropathic pain including heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in wild-type control mice, which developed after 4 weeks and was maintained after 8 weeks. Notably, SCI-induced heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were prevented in transgenic mice with Cx43/Cx30 deletions, but fully developed in transgenic mice with only Cx30 deletion. SCI-induced gliosis, detected as upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein in the spinal cord astrocytes at different stages of the injury, was also reduced in the knockout mice with Cx43/Cx30 deletions, when compared with littermate controls. In comparison, a standard regimen of post-SCI treatment of minocycline attenuated neuropathic pain to a significantly lesser degree than Cx43 deletion. These findings suggest Cx43 is critically linked to the development of central neuropathic pain following acute SCI.

In both PD patients and mouse models, there is increasing evidence that neuronal dysfunction occurs before the accumulation of protein aggregates (i.e., alpha-syn) and neurodegeneration. Characterization of the timing and nature of symptomatic dysfunction is important for understanding the impact of alpha-syn on disease progression. Furthermore, this knowledge is essential for identifying pathways and molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. To this end, we examined various functional and morphological endpoints in the transgenic mouse model expressing the human A53T alpha-syn variant directed by the mouse prion promoter at specific ages relating to disease progression (2, 6 and 12 months of age). Our findings indicate A53T mice develop fine, sensorimotor, and synaptic deficits before the onset of age-related gross motor and cognitive dysfunction.

Lutein was chosen as a representative and analyzed further in this study. It increased the synthesis, activity, and release of MMP-9 in murine RAW264.7 and primary-cultured peritoneal macrophages. MMP-9 induction by lutein was through the transcriptional regulation of mmp-9.

Moreover, lutein induced Nox activation and intracellular ROS production at an early stage of treatment.

Genetic fate mapping showed that Isl1(+) progeny specifically developed into a subpopulation of striatonigral neurons that transiently expressed Isl1.

As such, a critical issue arises as to how these factors govern the cell- and tissue-type switching. In this study, we explored genes directly activated by CDX1 in gastric epithelial cells and identified stemness-associated reprogramming factors SALL4 and KLF5. Indeed, SALL4 and KLF5 were aberrantly expressed in the CDX1(+) intestinal metaplasia of the stomach in both humans and mice. In cultured gastric epithelial cells, sustained expression of CDX1 gave rise to the induction of early intestinal-stemness markers, followed by the expression of intestinal-differentiation markers. Furthermore, the induction of these markers was suppressed by inhibiting either SALL4 or KLF5 expression, indicating that CDX1-induced SALL4 and KLF5 converted gastric epithelial cells into tissue stem-like progenitor cells, which then transdifferentiated into intestinal epithelial cells. Our study places the stemness-related reprogramming factors as critical components of CDX1-directed transcriptional circuitries that promote intestinal metaplasia.

In mice, pathological stress activates cardiomyocytes to express Brg1 (nucleosome-remodeling factor), G9a/Glp (histone methyltransferase), and Dnmt3 (DNA methyltransferase). Once activated, Brg1 recruits G9a and then Dnmt3 to sequentially assemble repressive chromatin-marked by H3K9 and CpG methylation-on a key molecular motor gene (Myh6), thereby silencing Myh6 and impairing cardiac contraction. Disruption of Brg1, G9a or Dnmt3 erases repressive chromatin marks and de-represses Myh6, reducing stress-induced cardiac dysfunction. In human hypertrophic hearts, BRG1-G9a/GLP-DNMT3 complex is also activated; its level correlates with H3K9/CpG methylation, Myh6 repression, and cardiomyopathy. Our studies demonstrate a new mechanism of chromatin assembly in stressed hearts and novel therapeutic targets for restoring Myh6 and ventricular function.

Consistent with an endothelial role for NRP1 in angiogenesis, we found that VEGFR2 and NRP1 were coexpressed in endothelial tip and stalk cells in the developing brain. In addition, NRP1 was expressed on two cell types that interact with growing brain vessels-the neural progenitors that secrete VEGF-A to stimulate tip cell activity and the pro-angiogenic macrophages that promote tip cell anastomosis. Selective targeting of Nrp1 in each of these cell types demonstrated that neural progenitor- and macrophage-derived NRP1 were dispensable, whereas endothelial NRP1 was essential for normal brain vessel growth. NRP1 therefore promotes brain angiogenesis cell autonomously in endothelium, independently of heterotypic interactions with nonendothelial cells. Genetic mosaic analyses demonstrated a key role for NRP1 in endothelial tip rather than stalk cells during vessel sprouting.

RESULTS: We used hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps to show a bona fide circadian rhythm of insulin action; mice are most resistant to insulin during their daily phase of relative inactivity. Moreover, clock-disrupted Bmal1-knockout mice are locked into the trough of insulin action and lack rhythmicity in insulin action and activity patterns. When rhythmicity is rescued in the Bmal1-knockout mice by expression of the paralogous gene Bmal2, insulin action and activity patterns are restored.

Although the role of the paracrine interaction between tumor cells and macrophages has been extensively studied, very little is known about the mechanism by which the autocrine CSF1R signaling contributes to tumor progression.

Abrogation of autocrine CSF1R signaling in MDA-MB-231 xenografts (a claudin-low cell line) leads to increased tumor size by enhanced proliferation, but significantly reduced invasion, dissemination and metastasis. Indeed, we show that proliferation and invasion are oppositely regulated by CSF1R downstream of TGFbeta only in claudin-low cell lines. Intravital multiphoton imaging revealed that inhibition of CSF1R in the tumor cells leads to decreased in vivo motility and a more cohesive morphology. We show that, both in vitro and in vivo, CSF1R inhibition results in a reversal of claudin-low marker expression by significant upregulation of luminal keratins and tight-junction proteins such as claudins.

To determine whether BRDT(DeltaBD1) protein results in altered transcription, we analyzed the transcriptomes of control versus Brdt(DeltaBD1/DeltaBD1) round spermatids. Over 400 genes showed statistically significant differential expression, and among the up-regulated genes, there was an enrichment of RNA splicing genes. Over 60% of these splicing genes had transcripts that lacked truncation of their 3'-untranslated region (UTR) typical of round spermatids. We selected four of these genes to characterize: Srsf2, Ddx5, Hnrnpk and Tardbp. The 3'-UTRs of Srsf2, Ddx5 and Hnrnpk mRNAs were longer in mutant round spermatids and resulted in reduced protein levels. Tardbp was transcriptionally up-regulated and a splicing shift toward the longer variant was observed. All four splicing proteins were found to complex with BRDT in control and mutant testes.

However, in various localized and systemic inflammatory conditions, intestinal homeostasis can be disturbed as a result of increased IEC shedding. Such pathological IEC shedding can cause transient gaps to develop in the epithelial barrier and result in increased intestinal permeability. Although pathological IEC shedding has been implicated in the pathogenesis of conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains limited. We have therefore developed a murine model to study this phenomenon, because IEC shedding in this species is morphologically analogous to humans.

Although proper gut function relies on the complex neuronal composition of the ENS, little is known about the transcriptional networks that regulate the diversification into different classes of enteric neurons and glia during development. Here we redefine the role of Ascl1 (Mash1), one of the few regulatory transcription factors described during ENS development. We show that enteric glia and all enteric neuronal subtypes appear to be derived from Ascl1-expressing progenitor cells. In the gut ofAscl1(-/-)mutant mice, neurogenesis is delayed and reduced, and posterior gliogenesis impaired. The ratio of neurons expressing Calbindin, TH, and VIP is selectively decreased while, for instance, 5-HT(+)neurons, which previously were believed to be Ascl1-dependent, are formed in normal numbers. Essentially the same differentiation defects are observed inAscl1(KINgn2)transgenic mutants, where the proneural activity of Ngn2 replaces Ascl1, demonstrating that Ascl1 is required for the acquisition of specific enteric neuronal subtype features independent of its role in neurogenesis. In this study, we provide novel insights into the expression and function of Ascl1 in the differentiation process of specific neuronal subtypes during ENS development.

This report identifies novel roles for the transcription factor Ascl1 in enteric gliogenesis and neurogenesis. Moreover, independent of its proneurogenic activity, Ascl1 is required for the normal expression of specific enteric neuronal subtype characteristics. Distinct enteric neuronal subtypes are formed in a temporally defined order, and we observe that the early-born 5-HT(+)neurons are generated inAscl1(-/-)mutants, despite the delayed neurogenesis.

SAA from the liver and extrahepatic tissues plays an immunomodulatory role in a variety of pathophysiological conditions. Inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral nerves have been implicated in the Wallerian degeneration of peripheral nerves after injury and in certain types of inflammatory neuropathies. In the present study, we found that a sciatic nerve axotomy could induce an increase of SAA1 and SAA3 mRNA expression in sciatic nerves. Immunohistochemical staining showed that Schwann cells are the primary sources of SAA production after nerve injury. In addition, interleukin-6-null mice, but not tumor necrosis factor-alpha-null mice showed a defect in the production of SAA1 in sciatic nerve following injury. Dexamethasone treatment enhanced the expression and secretion of SAA1 and SAA3 in sciatic nerve explants cultures, suggesting that interleukin-6 and corticosteroids might be major regulators for SAA production in Schwann cells following injury. Moreover, the stimulation of Schwann cells with SAA1 elicited the production of the macrophage chemoattractants, Ccl2 and Ccl3, in part through a G-protein coupled receptor.

In the developing mouse spinal cord, we found Sox13 predominantly expressed in neuroepithelial precursors, oligodendroglial and astroglial cells. The substantially overlapping expression with Sox5 and Sox6 in oligodendroglial cells prompted us to study potential roles during specification, lineage progression and differentiation of oligodendrocytes. In contrast to Sox5 and Sox6, Sox13 expression continues after differentiation and even increases in myelinating oligodendrocytes. Sox13 deletion did not interfere with oligodendroglial development, which was normal in Sox13-deficient mice. However, the premature differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors triggered by loss of Sox6 was slightly more prominent in Sox6/Sox13 double-deficient mice. Sox13 can bind to the same sites in myelin gene promoters as Sox5 and Sox6 in vitro. Reporter gene assays furthermore reveal a similar antagonizing effect on Sox10-dependent transactivation of myelin gene promoters as previously shown for Sox5 and Sox6. This argues that Sox13 is functionally redundant with the other SoxD proteins and complements Sox5 and Sox6 in their role as important modulators of oligodendrocyte development.

Obesity associated with Bdnf deficiency did not account for the reduced hyperactivity in double mutant mice. Bdnf deficiency did not alter amyloid plaque formation in APdE9 mice. Before plaque formation (3 months), BDNF protein levels where either reduced (female) or unaltered (male) in the APdE9 mouse cortex. Unexpectedly, this was followed by an age-dependent increase in mature BDNF protein. Bdnf mRNA and phospho-TrkB levels remained unaltered in the cortical tissue samples of middle-aged APdE9 mice.

Current therapeutic strategies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) aim to eliminate detrimental effects of the immune system, so far without reversing disability or affecting long-term prognosis in patients. Approachable molecular targets that stimulate CNS repair are not part of the clinical praxis or have not been identified yet. The purpose of this study was to identify the molecular target of the human monoclonal antibody HIgM12. HIgM12 reverses motor deficits in chronically demyelinated mice, a model of MS. Here, we identified polysialic acid (PSA) attached to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) as the antigen for HIgM12 by using different NCAM knockout strains and through PSA removal from the NCAM protein core. Antibody binding to CNS tissue and primary cells, antibody-mediated cell adhesion, and neurite outgrowth on HIgM12-coated nitrocellulose was detected only in the presence of PSA as assessed by western blotting, immunoprecipitation, immunocytochemistry, and histochemistry. We conclude that HIgM12 mediates it's in vivo and in vitro effects through binding to PSA and has the potential to be an effective therapy for MS and neurodegenerative diseases.

The IL-1beta mRNA and protein responses were significantly, though not completely, attenuated in microglia derived from TDAG8-deficient mice compared with those from wild-type mice.

To investigate the role of IFN-gamma, we developed novel IL-13(-/-) /IFN-gamma(-/-) double cytokine-deficient mice and examined disease progression in models of type 2-driven fibrosis. As predicted, we showed that fibrosis in the lung and liver are both highly dependent on IL-13. We also observed increased IFN-gamma production and inflammatory activity in the tissues of IL-13-deficient mice. Surprisingly, however, an even greater reduction in fibrosis was observed in IL-13/IFN-gamma double deficient mice, most notably in the livers of mice chronically infected with Schistosoma mansoni. The increased protection was associated with marked decreases in Tgfb1, Mmp12, and Timp1 mRNA expression in the tissues; reduced inflammation; and decreased expression of important pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha. Experiments conducted with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to IL-13 and IFN-gamma validated the findings with the genetically deficient mice. Together, these studies demonstrate that the reduction in fibrosis observed when IL-13 signalling is suppressed is not dependent on increased IFN-gamma activity. Instead, by reducing compensatory increases in type 1-associated inflammation, therapeutic strategies that block IFN-gamma and IL-13 activity simultaneously can confer greater protection from progressive fibrosis than IL-13 blockade alone.

Moreover, H-2Z1 closely reports most of the body and brain expression sites of the Satb1 chromatin remodeling gene including tooth buds, thymic epithelium, pontine nuclei, fastigial cerebellar nuclei, and cerebral cortex. Second, the H-2Z1 transgene causes insertional mutagenesis of Tbc1d5 and Satb1, leading to a strong decrease in their expressions. Finally, insertion of H-2Z1 affects the differentiation of a subset of cortical GABAergic interneurons, a possible consequence of downregulation of Satb1 expression.

We have reported that deletion of activating FcgammaRs in apolipoprotein E (apoE) single knockout mice attenuated atherosclerosis. In this report, we investigated the hypothesis that deficiency of inhibitory FcgammaRIIb exacerbates atherosclerosis. APPROACH AND RESULTS: ApoE-FcgammaRIIb double knockout mice, congenic to the C57BL/6 (apoE-FcgammaRIIbB6 (-/-)), were generated and atherosclerotic lesions were assessed. In contrary to our hypothesis, when compared with apoE single knockout mice, arterial lesions were significantly decreased in apoE-FcgammaRIIbB6 (-/-) male and female mice fed chow or high-fat diets. Chimeric mice generated by transplanting apoE-FcgammaRIIbB6 (-/-) marrow into apoE single knockout mice also developed reduced lesions. CD4(+) T cells from apoE-FcgammaRIIbB6 (-/-) mice produced higher levels of interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-beta than their apoE single knockout counterparts. As our findings conflict with a previous report using apoE-FcgammaRIIb129/B6 (-/-) mice on a mixed genetic background, we investigated whether strain differences contributed to the anti-inflammatory response. Macrophages from FcgammaRIIb129/B6 (-/-) mice on a mixed genetic background produced more interleukin-1beta and MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) in response to immune complexes, whereas congenic FcgammaRIIbB6 (-/-) mice generated more interleukin-10 and significantly less interleukin-1beta. Interestingly, the expression of lupus-associated slam genes, located in proximity to fcgr2b in mouse chromosome 1, is upregulated only in mixed FcgammaRIIb129/B6 (-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a detrimental role for FcgammaRIIb signaling in atherosclerosis and the contribution of anti-inflammatory cytokine responses in the attenuated lesions observed in apoE-FcgammaRIIbB6 (-/-) mice.

The thalamocortical tract forms during embryonic development controlled by mechanisms that are not fully understood. beta-catenin is a nuclear and cytosolic protein that transduces signals from secreted signaling molecules to regulate both cell motility via the cytoskeleton and gene expression in the nucleus. In this study we tested whether beta-catenin is likely to play a role in thalamocortical connectivity by examining its expression and activity in developing thalamic neurons and their axons. RESULTS: At embryonic day (E)15.5, the time when thalamocortical axonal projections are forming, we found that the thalamus is a site of particularly high beta-catenin mRNA and protein expression. As well as being expressed at high levels in thalamic cell bodies, beta-catenin protein is enriched in the axons and growth cones of thalamic axons and its growth cone concentration is sensitive to Netrin-1. Using mice carrying the beta-catenin reporter BAT-gal we find high levels of reporter activity in the thalamus. Further, Netrin-1 induces BAT-gal reporter expression and upregulates levels of endogenous transcripts encoding beta-actin and L1 proteins in cultured thalamic cells. We found that beta-catenin mRNA is enriched in thalamic axons and its 3'UTR is phylogenetically conserved and is able to direct heterologous mRNAs along the thalamic axon, where they can be translated. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that beta-catenin protein is likely to be an important player in thalamocortcial development. It is abundant both in the nucleus and in the growth cones of post-mitotic thalamic cells during the development of thalamocortical connectivity and beta-catenin mRNA is targeted to thalamic axons and growth cones where it could potentially be translated. beta-catenin is involved in transducing the Netrin-1 signal to thalamic cells suggesting a mechanism by which Netrin-1 guides thalamocortical development.", "publish_time": "2012-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 5, "histogram": 1, "fluorescence": 6, "3D structure": 3, "gel/blot": 2, "other diagram": 1}}, "5749887": {"cord_uid": "5749887", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "The A-kinase Anchoring Protein GSKIP Regulates GSK3beta Activity and Controls Palatal Shelf Fusion in Mice.", "abstract": "A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) represent a family of structurally diverse proteins, all of which bind PKA.

We determined that Ar DNA methylation decreases in UGS mesenchyme during prostate bud formation in vivo and that this change correlates with decreased DNA methyltransferase expression in the same cell population during the same time period.

As a measure of prostate development, in situ hybridization was used to visualize and count Nkx3-1 mRNA positive prostatic buds. We determined that inhibiting DNA methylation when prostatic buds are being specified, accelerates the onset of prostatic bud development, increases bud number, and sensitizes the budding response to androgens. Inhibition of DNA methylation also reduces Ar DNA methylation in UGS explants and increases Ar mRNA and protein in UGS mesenchyme and epithelium.

A subset of Nlrs assembles inflammasomes, molecular platforms that are activated in response to endogenous danger and microbial ligands and that control release of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18. However, their role in response to injury in the nervous system is less understood. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the expression profile of major inflammasome components in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and explored the physiological role of different Nlrs upon acute nerve injury in mice. RESULTS: While in basal conditions, predominantly members of NOD-like receptor B (Nlrb) subfamily (NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory proteins (NAIPs)) and Nlrc subfamily (ICE-protease activating factor (IPAF)/NOD) are detected in the sciatic nerve, injury causes a shift towards expression of the Nlrp family. Sterile nerve injury also leads to an increase in expression of the Nlrb subfamily, while bacteria trigger expression of the Nlrc subfamily. Interestingly, loss of Nlrp6 led to strongly impaired nerve function upon nerve crush. Loss of the inflammasome adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and effector caspase-1 and caspase-11 did not affect sciatic nerve function, suggesting that Nlrp6 contributed to recovery after peripheral nerve injury independently of inflammasomes. In line with this, we did not detect release of mature IL-1beta upon acute nerve injury despite potent induction of pro-IL-1beta and inflammasome components Nlrp3 and Nlrp1. However, Nlrp6 deficiency was associated with increased pro-inflammatory extracellular regulated MAP kinase (ERK) signaling, suggesting that hyperinflammation in the absence of Nlrp6 exacerbated peripheral nerve injury. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our observations suggest that Nlrp6 contributes to recovery from peripheral nerve injury by dampening inflammatory responses independently of IL-1beta and inflammasomes.", "publish_time": "2015-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 6, "other diagram": 4, "3D structure": 4, "macromolecule sequence": 2, "fluorescence": 3, "gel/blot": 1}}, "5639124": {"cord_uid": "5639124", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Mesodermal expression of Moz is necessary for cardiac septum development.", "abstract": "Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are the most commonly occurring congenital heart defect.

METHODS: Primary murine hepatocytes (PMHs) from wild type mice and WHV transgenic (Tg) mice were prepared and treated with defined siRNAs. The mRNA levels of target genes and ISGs were detected by real-time RT-PCR. The involvement of the signaling pathways including RIG-I/MDA5, PKR, and TLR3/7/8/9 was examined by specific inhibition and the analysis of their activation by Western blotting. RESULTS: In PMHs from WHV Tg mice, specific siRNAs targeting WHV, mouse beta-actin, and GAPDH reduced the levels of targeted mRNAs and increased the mRNA expression of IFN-beta, MxA, and IP-10. The enhanced ISG expression by siRNA transfection were abolished by siRNA-specific 2'-O-methyl antisense RNA and the inhibitors 2-AP and chloroquine blocking PKR and other TLR-mediated signaling pathways. Furthermore, Western blotting revealed that RNAi results in an increase in PKR phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-eB, indicating the possible role of IRF3 in the RNAi-directed induction of ISGs. In contrast, silencing of RIG-I and MDA5 failed to block RNAi-mediated MxA induction.

Because Nec-1 also prevents early oxidative injury, we hypothesized that mechanisms involved in this neuroprotection may involve preservation of mitochondrial function and prevention of secondary energy failure. Therefore, our objective was to determine if Nec-1 treatment following neonatal HI attenuates oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury. Postnatal day (p) 7 mice exposed to HI were injected intracerebroventricularly with 0.1 muL (80 mumol) of Nec-1 or vehicle. Nec-1 treatment prevented nitric oxide (NO*), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 3-nitrotyrosine increase, and attenuated glutathione oxidation that was found in vehicle-treated mice at 3h following HI. Similarly, Nec-1 following HI prevented: (i) up-regulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) and BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) expression, (ii) decline in mitochondrial complex-I activity, (iii) decrease in ATP levels, and (iv) mitochondrial structural pathology in astrocytes and in neurons.

However, because Pitx2 is also a major regulator of later stages of tooth development, especially during amelogenesis, it is unclear how mutant forms cause ARS dental anomalies. In this report, we outline the transcriptional mechanism that is defective in ARS. We demonstrate that during normal tooth development Pitx2 activates Amelogenin (Amel) expression, whose product is required for enamel formation, and that this regulation is perturbed by missense PITX2 mutations found in ARS patients. We further show that Pitx2-mediated Amel activation is controlled by chromatin-associated factor Hmgn2, and that Hmgn2 prevents Pitx2 from efficiently binding to and activating the Amel promoter. Consistent with a physiological significance to this interaction, we show that K14-Hmgn2 transgenic mice display a severe loss of Amel expression on the labial side of the lower incisors, as well as enamel hypoplasia-consistent with the human ARS phenotype.

To test whether a similar plasticity is present in hair cell fate commitment, we have generated a knockin (KI) mouse line (Atoh1(KINeurog1)) in which Atoh1 is replaced by Neurog1.

In particular, mammalian cells are known to express multiple anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. However, the cells of the developing brain could also exist in a primed state in which the loss of a single anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein is sufficient to trigger apoptosis. Here, we examined the critical role of Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic protein, during brain development. Using conditional knock-out mice in which Bcl-xL is deleted in neural progenitor cells (Bcl-xL(Emx1-Cre)), we show that the loss of Bcl-xL is not sufficient to trigger apoptosis in these proliferating progenitors. In contrast, specific populations of postmitotic neurons derived from these progenitors, including upper layer cortical neurons and the CA1-CA3 regions of the hippocampus, were acutely dependent on Bcl-xL. Consistent with this finding, deletion of Bcl-xL selectively in the postmitotic neurons in the brain (Bcl-xL(Nex-Cre)) also resulted in similar patterns of apoptosis.

Instead, Bcl-xL deficiency induced apoptosis in a select population of differentiated neurons predominantly in the early postnatal stages. Importantly, these Bcl-xL-dependent neurons are not essential for survival of the organism but instead regulate complex behaviors.

Although blood pressure of Ang II-infused Tg mice was comparable with that of Ang II-infused Wt mice, the Ang II-mediated development of aortic vascular hypertrophy was partially inhibited in Tg mice compared with Wt mice. In addition, Ang II-mediated up-regulation of vascular Nox4 and p22(phox), NADPH oxidase components, and 4-HNE, a marker of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, was significantly suppressed in Tg mice, with a concomitant inhibition of activation of aortic vascular p38MAPK and JNK by Ang II.

The ciliary body is similar in many respects to the choroid plexus of the brain, and we demonstrated previously the importance of VEGF-A in maintenance of choroid plexus vasculature and ependymal cells. Therefore, the role of VEGF-A in ciliary body homeostasis was explored. METHODS: Swiss-Webster mice (VEGF-LacZ) were used to determine VEGF-A expression during ciliary body development and in the adult. VEGFR2 expression was determined in adult wild type C56BL/6J mice. Systemic VEGF-A neutralization in vivo was achieved with adenovirus-mediated overexpression of soluble VEGFR1 (sFlt1). Following VEGF-A neutralization, the ciliary epithelium was analyzed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The effect of VEGF-A blockade on ciliary body function also was assessed by measuring intraocular pressure. RESULTS: VEGF-A expression was detected at embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5), the onset of ciliary process formation. In the adult ciliary body, VEGF-A was expressed by the pigmented epithelium, whereas VEGFR2 was localized primarily to the capillary endothelium and nonpigmented epithelium. Systemic VEGF-A neutralization led to a thinning of the nonpigmented epithelium, vacuolization of the pigmented epithelium, loss of capillary fenestrations, and thrombosis. These changes were associated with impaired ciliary body function, as evidenced by decreased intraocular pressure in sFlt1-overexpressing animals (15.31 +/- 2.06 mm Hg) relative to controls (18.69 +/- 1.49 mm Hg).

Less nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and lower beta-catenin target gene expression levels was observed in the HuVECs expressing lower levels of endogenous MMP8. Knockdown of endogenous MMP8 in HuVECs down-regulated platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) expression by converting less angiotensin I to II, which is an inducer for PECAM-1 gene expression. Aortic rings isolated from MMP8(-/-)/apoE(-/-) mice had less endothelial cell sprouting, and endothelial cells in MMP8(-/-)/apoE(-/-) mice had a lower ability to migrate into Matrigel plugs and less capacity of proliferation and angiogenesis. Moreover, immunohistochemical analyses revealed that MMP8 was expressed in microvessels within human atherosclerotic plaques and aneurysm. Finally, analyses of MMP8(-/-)/apoE(-/-) and MMP8(+/+)/apoE(-/-) mice fed a Western diet for 12 weeks showed that MMP8-deficient mice had small lesion size and less endothelial cells within atherosclerotic lesions.

RESULTS: In this study, we examined the roles of the zinc finger gene Fezf2 in the development of the amygdala. Fezf2 is expressed in the lateral and basolateral nuclei during development. In Fezf2-deficient embryos, specific excitatory neuron markers in the lateral and basolateral nuclei were reduced, with concurrent induction of other markers in the endopiriform cortex. Furthermore, the morphology of the lateral and basolateral nuclei was abnormal. In the adult stages, excitatory neurons in the lateral and basolateral nuclei were greatly reduced because of apoptosis that occurred soon after birth.

Testin shares a PET-LIM homology with Pk. It is not clear whether Testin acts in PCP processes in mammals. Results: We identified Testin as a Vangl2-interacting protein through a 2-hybrid screen with a cochlea cDNA library. Testin is enriched to cell-cell boundaries in the presence of Vangl2 in cultured cells.

To determine whether the impairment of RARalpha signaling directly contributes to the development of heart dysfunction and the involved mechanisms, tamoxifen-induced myocardial specific RARalpha deletion (RARalphaKO) mice were utilized. Echocardiographic and cardiac catheterization studies showed significant diastolic dysfunction after 16wks of gene deletion. However, no significant differences were observed in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), between RARalphaKO and wild type (WT) control mice. DHE staining showed increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the hearts of RARalphaKO mice. Significantly increased NOX2 (NADPH oxidase 2) and NOX4 levels and decreased SOD1 and SOD2 levels were observed in RARalphaKO mouse hearts, which were rescued by overexpression of RARalpha in cardiomyocytes. Decreased SERCA2a expression and phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB), along with decreased phosphorylation of Akt and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CaMKII delta) was observed in RARalphaKO mouse hearts. Ca(2+) reuptake and cardiomyocyte relaxation were delayed by RARalpha deletion. Overexpression of RARalpha or inhibition of ROS generation or NOX activation prevented RARalpha deletion-induced decrease in SERCA2a expression/activation and delayed Ca(2+) reuptake. Moreover, the gene and protein expression of RARalpha was significantly decreased in aged or metabolic stressed mouse hearts. RARalpha deletion accelerated the development of diastolic dysfunction in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic mice or in high fat diet fed mice. In conclusion, myocardial RARalpha deletion promoted diastolic dysfunction, with a relative preserved LVEF. Increased oxidative stress have an important role in the decreased expression/activation of SERCA2a and Ca(2+) mishandling in RARalphaKO mice, which are major contributing factors in the development of diastolic dysfunction.

Here we introduce a vangl2 knockout mouse and directly compare the severity of the knockout and Looptail mutant phenotypes by intercrossing the two lines and assaying the planar polarity of inner ear hair cells. Overall the vangl2 knockout phenotype is milder than the phenotype of compound mutants carrying both the Looptail and vangl2 knockout alleles. In compound mutants a greater number of hair cells are affected and changes in the orientation of individual hair cells are greater when quantified. We further demonstrate in a heterologous cell system that the protein encoded by the Looptail mutation (Vangl2(S464N)) disrupts delivery of Vangl1 and Vangl2 proteins to the cell surface as a result of oligomer formation between Vangl1 and Vangl2(S464N), or Vangl2 and Vangl2(S464N), coupled to the intracellular retention of Vangl2(S464N). As a result, Vangl1 protein is missing from the apical cell surface of vestibular hair cells in Looptail mutants, but is retained at the apical cell surface of hair cells in vangl2 knockouts. Similarly the distribution of Prickle-like2, a putative Vangl2 interacting protein, is differentially affected in the two mutant lines.

In this study we aimed to test the potential interaction between PTEN and KRAS mutation in biliary tract malignancy. We used an inducible Cre-LoxP-based approach to coordinately delete PTEN and activate KRAS within the adult mouse biliary epithelium. We found that activation of KRAS alone has little effect upon biliary epithelium. Loss of PTEN alone results in the development of low-grade neoplastic lesions, following long latency and at low incidence. Combination of both mutations causes rapid development of biliary epithelial proliferative lesions, which progress through dysplasia to invasive carcinoma. We conclude that activation of the PI3'K pathway following loss of PTEN is sufficient to drive slow development of low-grade biliary lesions in mice. In contrast, mutational activation of KRAS does not result in a similar phenotype, despite a prediction that this should activate both the RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3'-kinase pathways. However, mutation of both genes results in rapid tumourigenesis, arguing that PTEN normally functions as a 'brake' on the PI3'-kinase pathway, limiting the influence of KRAS activation.

The underlying mechanism whereby missense alterations in LRRK2 initiate neurodegeneration remains largely unclear. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been recognized to contribute to the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial PD. The pathogenic gain-of-function mutant form of LRRK2, LRRK2 G2019S, is associated with elevated kinase activity and PD. Here we show that LRRK2 G2019S can cause defects in the morphology and dynamics of mitochondria in cortical neurons. In neurons, endogenous LRRK2 and the mitochondrial fission factor Dynamin like protein 1 (DLP1) interact with and partially co-localize with each other. DLP1 plays an essential role in LRRK2-induced mitochondrial fission. In support of this, expression of LRRK2 leads to the translocation of DLP1 from the cytosol to the mitochondria and knockdown of DLP1 expression inhibits LRRK2-induced mitochondrial fission. In addition, co-expression of LRRK2 and DLP1 induces mitochondrial clearance. Furthermore, we have found that expression of LRRK2 leads to increased reactive oxygen species levels in cells. Taken together, our results provide insights into the pathobiology of LRRK2 and suggest that LRRK2 G2019S may induce neuronal dysfunction or cell death by disturbing normal mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics and function.", "publish_time": "2012-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 2, "macromolecule sequence": 2, "other diagram": 31}}, "5695384": {"cord_uid": "5695384", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Novel Regulation of the Synthesis of alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic Acid (AMPA) Receptor Subunit GluA1 by Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C) in the Hippocampus.", "abstract": "The regulation of AMPA-type receptor (AMPAR) abundance in the postsynaptic membrane is an important mechanism involved in learning and memory formation. Recent data suggest that one of the constituents of the AMPAR complex is carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C), a brain-specific isoform located in the endoplasmic reticulum of neurons. Previous results had demonstrated that CPT1C deficiency disrupted spine maturation in hippocampal neurons and impaired spatial learning, but the role of CPT1C in AMPAR physiology had remained mostly unknown. In the present study, we show that CPT1C binds GluA1 and GluA2 and that the three proteins have the same expression profile during neuronal maturation. Moreover, in hippocampal neurons of CPT1C KO mice, AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and synaptic levels of AMPAR subunits GluA1 and GluA2 are significantly reduced. We show that AMPAR expression is dependent on CPT1C levels because total protein levels of GluA1 and GluA2 are decreased in CPT1C KO neurons and are increased in CPT1C-overexpressing neurons, whereas other synaptic proteins remain unaltered. Notably, mRNA levels of AMPARs remained unchanged in those cultures, indicating that CPT1C is post-transcriptionally involved. We demonstrate that CPT1C is directly involved in the de novo synthesis of GluA1 and not in protein degradation. Moreover, in CPT1C KO cultured neurons, GluA1 synthesis after chemical long term depression was clearly diminished, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor treatment was unable to phosphorylate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and stimulate GluA1 protein synthesis.

Acetylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of p53 (also known as TP53) was an early example of non-histone protein acetylation and its precise role remains unclear. Lysine acetylation often creates binding sites for bromodomain-containing 'reader' proteins. Here we use a proteomic screen to identify the oncoprotein SET as a major cellular factor whose binding with p53 is dependent on CTD acetylation status. SET profoundly inhibits p53 transcriptional activity in unstressed cells, but SET-mediated repression is abolished by stress-induced acetylation of p53 CTD. Moreover, loss of the interaction with SET activates p53, resulting in tumour regression in mouse xenograft models. Notably, the acidic domain of SET acts as a 'reader' for the unacetylated CTD of p53 and this mechanism of acetylation-dependent regulation is widespread in nature. For example, acetylation of p53 also modulates its interactions with similar acidic domains found in other p53 regulators including VPRBP (also known as DCAF1), DAXX and PELP1 (refs. 7, 8, 9), and computational analysis of the proteome has identified numerous proteins with the potential to serve as acidic domain readers and lysine-rich ligands. Unlike bromodomain readers, which preferentially bind the acetylated forms of their cognate ligands, the acidic domain readers specifically recognize the unacetylated forms of their ligands. Finally, the acetylation-dependent regulation of p53 was further validated in vivo by using a knock-in mouse model expressing an acetylation-mimicking form of p53.

Kif7 possesses Sufu-dependent and -independent regulatory functions in Hh signaling: while it promotes Hh pathway activity through the dissociation of Sufu-Gli2 complex, it also contributes to the repression of Hh target genes in the absence of Sufu.

We investigated the effect of E2 on Th17 differentiation in vivo and IL-17 mediated regulation of osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation. Additionally, effect of IL-17 functional block under E2 deficiency-induced bone loss was studied. In murine bone marrow cells, E2 suppressed IL-17 mediated osteoclast differentiation. IL-17 inhibited formation of mineralized nodules in osteoblasts and this effect was suppressed by E2. E2 treatment to mouse calvarial osteoblasts inhibited the IL-17-induced production of osteoclastogenic cytokines and NF-kB translocation. In ovariectomized mice, there was increase in the number of Th17 cells, transcription factors promoting Th17 cell differentiation and circulating IL-17 levels.

How miRNA accomplishes its pleiotropic effects largely depends on its expression and its target repertoire. Previous studies discovered thousands of miRNAs and numerous miRNA target genes mainly through computation and prediction methods which produced high rates of false positive prediction. The development of Argonaute cross-linked immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-Seq) provides a system to effectively determine miRNA target genes. Likewise, the accuracy of dissecting the transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes has been greatly improved by chromatin immunoprecipitation of the transcription factors coupled with sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Elucidation of the miRNA target repertoire will provide an in-depth understanding of the functional roles of microRNA pathways. To reliably reconstruct a miRNA-mediated regulatory network, we established a computational framework using publicly available, sequence-based transcription factor-miRNA databases, including ChIPBase and TransmiR for the TF-miRNA interactions, along with miRNA-target databases, including miRTarBase, TarBase and starBase, for the miRNA-target interactions. We applied the computational framework to elucidate the miRNA-mediated regulatory network in the Mir122a(-)/(-) mouse model, which has an altered transcriptome and progressive liver disease. RESULTS: We applied our computational framework to the expression profiles of miRNA/mRNA of Mir122a(-)/(-) mutant mice and wild-type mice. The miRNA-mediated network involves 40 curated TFs contributing to the aberrant expression of 65 miRNAs and 723 curated miRNA target genes, of which 56% was found in the differentially-expressed genes of Mir122a--mice. Hence, the regulatory network disclosed previously-known and also many previously-unidentified miRNA-mediated regulations in mutant mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of imprinting at the chromosome 12qF1 region is associated with miRNA overexpression in human hepatocellular carcinoma and stem cells, suggesting initiation of precancerous changes in young mice deficient in miR-122. A group of 9 miRNAs was found to share miR-122 target genes, indicating synergy between miRNAs and target genes by way of multiplicity and cooperativity. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides significant insight into miRNA-mediated regulatory networks.

Isolated hearts and field-stimulated LV myocytes (3 Hz, 35 degrees C) overexpressing GCH1 showed a faster relaxation and a PKA-mediated increase in the PLB Ser16 phosphorylated fraction and in the rate of decay of the [Ca2+]i transient. RyR2 S-nitrosylation and diastolic Ca2+ leak were larger in mGCH1-Tg and ICa density was lower; nevertheless the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient and contraction did not differ between genotypes, because of an increase in the SR fractional release of Ca2+ in mGCH1-Tg myocytes. Xanthine oxidoreductase inhibition abolished the difference in superoxide production but did not affect myocardial function in either group. By contrast, NOS1 inhibition abolished the differences in ICa density, Ser16 PLB phosphorylation, [Ca2+]i decay, and myocardial relaxation between genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial GCH1 activity and intracellular BH4 are a limiting factor for constitutive NOS1 and SERCA2A activity in the healthy myocardium.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic and neurogenic factor, which has been shown to elicit antidepressant-like effects in response to different external stimuli, potentially functioning as an anti-stress molecule. However, it remains largely unknown how VEGF modulates mood-related behaviors. To investigate molecular correlates, we analyzed monoaminergic systems of VEGF transgenic mice that display antidepressant-like behavior. Immunostaining showed that overall morphologies of monoaminergic nuclei and their processes were normal. However, we found imbalances in brain monoamine contents, in which the levels of norepinephrine and serotonin, but not dopamine, were decreased exclusively in the regions where VEGF was expressed. The turnover of norepinephrine showed a marked increase and serotonin turnover showed a modest reduction, whereas dopamine turnover was not affected. The protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzymes of catecholamine and serotonin synthesis, remained constant. The mRNA levels of monoamine receptors were generally similar but adrenergic receptors of ADRalpha1A and ADRbeta1 were down-regulated. Behavioral tests showed that serotonin- or norepinephrine-selective antidepressant drugs failed to additively enhance antidepressant-like behaviors, whereas monoamine depleting drugs attenuated VEGF-mediated antidepressant-like effect.

In ocular cells, Pax6 transcription is regulated by CTCF through its binding to specific sites in Pax6 promoter. In this study, CTCF-mediated regulations of islet alpha-cell development and glucagon production were investigated in both CTCF transgenic mice and alpha-TC-1-6 cells. Over-expression of CTCF in transgenic mice affected development of pancreatic islets by significantly suppressing alpha-cell population in both embryonic and adult pancreases. The effect of CTCF on Pax6 gene expression and subsequently, on pro-glucagon production was however, examined in pancreatic islet alpha-cells. Over-expression and knock-down of CTCF directly affected Pax6 expression. More importantly, the CTCF binding sites upstream from Pax6 p0 promoter were required for regulating p0 promoter activity in islet alpha-cells. Stimulation of alpha-cells with insulin resulted in a significant increase in CTCF expression and a decrease in Pax6 expression, and consequently suppressed pro-glucagon expression. In contrast, these insulin-induced effects were blocked by knockdown of CTCF mRNA with specific siRNA in alpha-cells.

The objectives of the present study were to characterize the expression pattern and kinase activity of MTOR during follicular and corpus luteum development, and to examine how inhibition of MTOR kinase activity affects preovulatory maturation of ovarian follicles. MTOR expression was constitutive throughout follicular and corpus luteum development. Gonadotropins induced MTOR kinase activity in the ovary, which was inhibited by rapamycin treatment (10 microg/g body weight, intraperitoneal injection). Inhibition of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-induced MTOR activity during preovulatory follicle maturation did not change key events of ovulation. Granulosa cells of rapamycin-treated mice showed reduced MTOR kinase activity at 1 and 4 hr post-hCG and overexpression of hCG-induced ovulation genes at 4 hr post-hCG. Overexpression of these ovulatory genes was associated with hyper-activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), which occurred in response to inhibition of MTOR with rapamycin and suggested that MTOR may function as a negative regulator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Indeed, simultaneous inhibition of MTOR and ERK1/2 activities during preovulatory follicle maturation caused anovulation. Inhibition of hCG-induced ERK1/2 activity alone suppressed MTOR kinase activity, indicating that MAPK pathway is upstream of MTOR.

Despite increasing interest in lipofibroblast biology, little is known about their cellular origin or the molecular pathways controlling their formation during embryonic development. Here, we show that a population of lipid-droplet-containing stromal cells emerges in the developing mouse lung between E15.5 and E16.5. This is accompanied by significant upregulation, in the lung mesenchyme, of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (master switch of lipogenesis), adipose differentiation-related protein (marker of mature lipofibroblasts) and fibroblast growth factor 10 (previously shown to identify a subpopulation of lipofibroblast progenitors).

Shp2 ablation initiated the untimely and excessive differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) by disturbing the expression of paracrine factors.

Furthermore, Shp2 deletion impaired the cell junctions of the primary Sertoli cells and failed to support the clonal formation of SSCs co-cultured with SCSKO Sertoli cells. As expected, Shp2 restoration largely restores the cell junctions of the primary Sertoli cells and the clonal formation of SSCs. To identify the underlying mechanism, we further demonstrated that the absence of Shp2 suppressed Erk phosphorylation, and thus, the expression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)- and testosterone-induced target genes.

Therefore, a conditional allele of this gene is necessary to understand the function of R-spondins throughout murine development.

We used these mice to investigate the role of Rspo3 during limb development and found that limbs ultimately developed normally in the absence of Rspo3 function.

Here, we used various experimental approaches in two model systems (chick and mouse) to assess the contribution of retinoic acid signaling in the induction of the olfactory epithelium, the generation and maintenance of progenitor populations, and the ontogenesis and differentiation of olfactory neurons. RESULTS: We show that retinoic acid signaling, although dispensable for initial induction of the olfactory placode, plays a key role in neurogenesis within this neuroepithelium. Retinoic acid depletion in the olfactory epithelium, both in chick and mouse models, results in a failure of progenitor cell maintenance and, consequently, differentiation of olfactory neurons is not sustained. Using an explant system, we further show that renewal of olfactory neurons is hindered if the olfactory epithelium is unable to synthesize retinoic acid.

All serial sections were dual-immunolabeled with Pecam1 and Pgp9.5/Gap43 cocktail antibodies. All immunolabeled serial sections were digitized with virtual microscopy to acquire high spatial resolution images. The 3D reconstructs warranted superior positional accuracy to trace the long-range connectivity of blood vessels and individual cranial nerve axons. It was feasible to depict simultaneously the details of angiogenic sprouting and axon terminal arborization and to assess quantitatively the locoregional proximity between blood vessels and cranial nerve axons. Notably, 3D views of the craniofacial region revealed the following: Branchial arch arteries and blood capillary plexi were formed without accompanying nerves at embryonic day (E) 9.5. Cranial nerve axons began to grow into the branchial arches, developing a labyrinth of small blood vessels at E10.5. Vascular remodeling occurred, and axon terminals of the maxillary, mandibular, chorda tympani, and hypoglossal nerve axons had arborized around the lateral lingual swellings at E11.5. The diverged patterning of trigeminal nerves and the arterial branches from the carotid artery became congruent at E11.5.

In addition, binding of vinculin to beta-catenin, as well as linkage of vinculin to F-actin, are also significantly compromised upon phosphorylation of cortactin. Accordingly, we found that regulation of cell-cell adhesion by phosphorylation of cortactin downstream of RhoA and PKD1 is vitally dependent on vinculin-mediated protein interactions.

We show that marginal zone B cells are highly motile and exhibit long membrane extensions. Marginal zone B cells shuttle between the marginal zone and follicles with at least one-fifth of the cells exchanging between compartments per hour, a behaviour that explains their ability to deliver antigens rapidly from the open blood circulation to the secluded follicles. Follicular B cells also transit from follicles to the marginal zone, but unlike marginal zone B cells, they fail to undergo integrin-mediated adhesion, become caught in fluid flow and are carried into the red pulp.

However, the mechanism by which Cbfbeta regulates cartilage and bone development remains unclear. Existing Cbfbeta-deficient mouse models cannot specify the role of Cbfbeta in skeletal cell lineage. Herein, we sought to specifically address the role of Cbfbeta in cartilage and bone development by using a conditional knockout (CKO) approach. A mesenchymal-specific Cbfbeta CKO mouse model was generated by using the Dermo1-Cre mouse line to specifically delete Cbfbeta in mesenchymal stem cells, which give rise to osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Surprisingly, the mutant mice had under-developed larynx and tracheal cartilage, causing alveolus defects that led to death shortly after birth from suffocation. Also, the mutant mice exhibited severe skeletal deformities from defective intramembranous and endochondral ossification, owing to delayed chondrocyte maturation and impaired osteoblast differentiation. Almost all bones of the mutant mice, including the calvariae, vertebrae, tibiae, femurs, ribs, limbs and sternums were defective. Importantly, we showed that Cbfbeta was expressed throughout the skeleton during both embryonic and postnatal development, which explains the multiple-skeletal defects observed in the mutant mice. Consistently, Cbfbeta deficiency impaired both chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy zone hypertrophy during growth-plate development in the long bones of mutant mice. Notably, Cbfbeta, Runx1 and Runx2 displayed different expression patterns in the growth plates of the wild-type mice, indicating that Cbfbeta/Runx1 complex and Cbfbeta/Runx2 complex may regulate chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, respectively, in a spatial and temporal manner. Cbfbeta deletion in the mesenchymal progenitors affected bone development by dramatically down-regulating Collagen X (Col X) and Osterix (Osx) but had a dispensable effect on osteoclast development. Collectively, the results demonstrate that Cbfbeta mediates cartilage and bone development by interacting with Runx1 and Runx2 to regulate the expressions of Col X and Osx for chondrocyte and osteoblast development.

In vivo deletion of Cdc42 in embryonic ECs (Cdc42(Tie2KO)) results in blocked lumen formation and endothelial tearing, leading to lethality of mutant embryos by E9-10 due to failed blood circulation. Similarly, inducible deletion of Cdc42 (Cdc42(Cad5KO)) at mid-gestation blocks angiogenic tubulogenesis. By contrast, deletion of Cdc42 in postnatal retinal vessels leads to aberrant vascular remodeling and sprouting, as well as markedly reduced filopodia formation. We find that Cdc42 is essential for organization of EC adhesion, as its loss results in disorganized cell-cell junctions and reduced focal adhesions. Endothelial polarity is also rapidly lost upon Cdc42 deletion, as seen by failed localization of apical podocalyxin (PODXL) and basal actin. We link observed failures to a defect in F-actin organization, both in vitro and in vivo, which secondarily impairs EC adhesion and polarity. We also identify Cdc42 effectors Pak2/4 and N-WASP, as well as the actomyosin machinery, to be crucial for EC actin organization.

To assess wild type and mutant LRRK2 in established neuronal networks, we conducted immunocytochemical, electrophysiological and biochemical characterization of >3 week old cortical cultures of LRRK2 knock-out, wild-type overexpressing and G2019S knock-in mice. Synaptic release and synapse numbers were grossly normal in LRRK2 knock-out cells, but discretely reduced glutamatergic activity and reduced synaptic protein levels were observed. Conversely, synapse density was modestly but significantly increased in wild-type LRRK2 overexpressing cultures although event frequency was not. In knock-in cultures, glutamate release was markedly elevated, in the absence of any change to synapse density, indicating that physiological levels of G2019S LRRK2 elevate probability of release.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined expression patterns in the embryonic myocardium and performed activation mapping in fetal and adult hearts, including hearts from adult mice heterozygous for a mutation associated with Brugada syndrome (Scn5a1798insD/+). The embryonic RVOT was characterized by expression of Tbx2, a repressor of differentiation, and absence of expression of both Hey2, a ventricular transcription factor, and Gja1, encoding the principal gap-junction subunit for ventricular fast conduction. Also, conduction velocity was lower in the RVOT than in the right ventricular free wall. Later in the development, Gja1 and Scn5a expression remained lower in the subepicardial myocardium of the RVOT than in RV myocardium. Nevertheless, conduction velocity in the adult RVOT was similar to that of the right ventricular free wall.

Thus, we investigated whether HCRT signaling plays a role in controlling cardiovascular variability during spontaneous behavior in HCRT-deficient mice. HCRT-ataxin3 transgenic mice lacking HCRT neurons (TG), knockout mice lacking HCRT peptides (KO), and wild-type controls (WT) were instrumented with electrodes for sleep recordings and a telemetric blood pressure transducer.

During NREMS, all mice had lower SBP variability, greater baroreflex contribution to HP control at low frequencies, and greater amplitude of the central autonomic and baroreflex changes in HP associated with SBP surges than during wakefulness. During REMS, all mice had higher SBP variability and depressed central autonomic and baroreflex HP controls relative to NREMS. HP variability during REMS was higher than during NREMS in WT only.

The growth arrest specific gene 1 (Gas1) encodes a GPI-anchored membrane protein known to bind to Sonic Hh (Shh), Indian Hh (Ihh), and Ret. However, its role in the GI tract has not been examined. Here we show that the Gas1 mutant GI tract, compared to the control, is shorter, has thinner smooth muscles, and contains more enteric progenitors that are abnormally distributed. These phenotypes are similar to those of the Shh mutant, supporting that Gas1 mediates most of the Shh activity in the GI tract. Because Gas1 has been shown to inhibit Ret signaling elicited by Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf), we explored whether Gas1 mutant enteric neurons displayed any alteration of Ret signaling levels. Indeed, isolated mutant enteric progenitors not only showed increased levels of phospho-Ret and its downstream effectors, phospho-Akt and phospho-Erk, but also displayed altered responses to Gdnf and Shh.

Recent clonal analysis and cell-tracing experiments indicate that a common progenitor pool in the posterior region of the SHF gives rise to both OFT and atrial myocytes. The mechanisms regulating deployment of this progenitor pool remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of TBX1, the major gene implicated in congenital heart defects in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome patients, in posterior SHF development. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using transcriptome analysis, genetic tracing, and fluorescent dye-labeling experiments, we show that Tbx1-dependent OFT myocardium originates in Hox-expressing cells in the posterior SHF. In Tbx1 null embryos, OFT progenitor cells fail to segregate from this progenitor cell pool, leading to failure to expand the dorsal pericardial wall and altered positioning of the cardiac poles. Unexpectedly, addition of SHF cells to the venous pole of the heart is also impaired, resulting in abnormal development of the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion, and partially penetrant atrioventricular septal defects, including ostium primum defects.

Mouse embryos homozygous for the knock-in mutation (Tcf3(DeltaN/DeltaN)) progress through gastrulation without apparent defects, thus genetically proving that Tcf3 function during gastrulation is independent of beta-catenin interaction.

Transcriptional profiling of motor neurons derived from Isl1 null embryonic stem cells revealed that transcripts of major genes involved in repulsive mechanisms were misregulated. Particularly, expression of Neuropilin1 (Npr1) and Slit2 mRNA was diminished in Islet mutant mice, and these could be target genes of the Islet proteins. Consistent with this mechanism, Robo and Slit mutations in mice and knockdown of Npr1 and Slit2 in chick embryos caused motor neurons to migrate to the periphery. Together, our study suggests that Islet genes engage Robo-Slit and Neuropilin-Semaphorin signaling in motor neurons to retain motor somata within the CNS.", "publish_time": "2015-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 22, "histogram": 7, "other diagram": 70, "fluorescence": 77, "gel/blot": 3, "light microscopy": 9}}, "5476390": {"cord_uid": "5476390", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Mutations in the NOTCH pathway regulator MIB1 cause left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) causes prominent ventricular trabeculations and reduces cardiac systolic function.

Recent studies identified novel subsets of innate lymphoid cells that are capable of mediating immune responses in mucosal organs. In this paper, we describe a subset of lymphoid cells that is involved in innate type 2 immunity in the lungs. Airway exposure of naive BALB/c or C57BL/6J mice to IL-33 results in a rapid (<12 h) production of IL-5 and IL-13 and marked airway eosinophilia independently of adaptive immunity. In the lungs of nonsensitized naive mice, IL-33-responsive cells were identified that have a lymphoid morphology, lack lineage markers, highly express CD25, CD44, Thy1.2, ICOS, Sca-1, and IL-7Ralpha (i.e., Lin(-)CD25(+)CD44(hi) lymphoid cells), and require IL-7Ralpha for their development. Airway exposure of naive mice to a clinically relevant ubiquitous fungal allergen, Alternaria alternata, increases bronchoalveolar lavage levels of IL-33, followed by IL-5 and IL-13 production and airway eosinophilia without T or B cells. This innate type 2 response to the allergen is nearly abolished in mice deficient in IL-33R (i.e., ST2), and the Lin(-)CD25(+)CD44(hi) lymphoid cells in the lungs are required and sufficient to mediate the response. Thus, a subset of innate immune cells that responds to IL-33 and vigorously produces Th2-type cytokines is present in mouse lungs.

The aim of the current study is to examine the effects of beta-cell-specific Mafk overexpression in endocrine cell development. The developing islets of Mafk-transgenic embryos appeared to be disorganized with an inversion of total numbers of insulin+ and glucagon+ cells due to reduced beta-cell proliferation. Gene expression analysis by quantitative RT-PCR revealed decreased levels of beta-cell-related genes whose expressions are known to be controlled by large MAF proteins. Additionally, these changes were accompanied with a significant increase in key beta-cell transcription factors likely due to compensatory mechanisms that might have been activated in response to the beta-cell loss. Finally, microarray comparison of gene expression profiles between wild-type and transgenic pancreata revealed alteration of some uncharacterized genes including Pcbd1, Fam132a, Cryba2, and Npy, which might play important roles during pancreatic endocrine development.

Toll-like receptor-9 (TLR9) is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor of the innate immune system that is currently under clinical investigation as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases. Here, we investigated whether TLR9 has a role in the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Newly generated double-knockout ApoE(-/-):TLR9(-/-) mice and control ApoE(-/-) mice were fed a high-fat diet from 8 weeks and effects on lesion size, cellular composition, inflammatory status, and plasma lipids were assessed after 8, 12, 15, and 20 weeks. All 4 time points demonstrated exacerbated atherosclerotic lesion severity in ApoE(-/-):TLR9(-/-) mice, with a corresponding increase in lipid deposition and accumulation of macrophages, dendritic cells, and CD4(+) T cells. Although ApoE(-/-):TLR9(-/-) mice exhibited an increase in plasma very low-density lipoprotein/low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, the very low-density lipoprotein/low-density lipoprotein:high-density lipoprotein ratio was unaltered because of a parallel increase in plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. As a potential mechanism accounting for plaque progression in ApoE(-/-):TLR9(-/-) mice, CD4(+) T-cell accumulation was further investigated and depletion of these cells in ApoE(-/-):TLR9(-/-) mice significantly reduced lesion severity. As a final translational approach, administration of a TLR9 agonist (type B CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1668) to ApoE(-/-) mice resulted in a reduction of lesion severity. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic deletion of the innate immune receptor TLR9 exacerbated atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet. CD4(+) T cells were identified as potential mediators of this effect. A type B CpG oligodeoxynucleotide TLR9 agonist reduced lesion severity, thus identifying a novel therapeutic approach in atherosclerosis.", "publish_time": "2014-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 15, "fluorescence": 13, "gel/blot": 2}}, "5634637": {"cord_uid": "5634637", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Visualisation and characterisation of oestrogen receptor alpha-positive neurons expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the oestrogen receptor alpha promoter.", "abstract": "Oestrogen receptor (ER)alpha plays important roles in the development and function of various neuronal systems through activation by its ligands, oestrogens.

In three independent tg lines, GFP-positive neurons were observed in areas previously reported to express ERalpha mRNA, including the lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic nucleus (MPO), hypothalamus, and amygdala. In these areas, GFP signals mostly overlapped with ERalpha immunoreactivity. GFP fluorescence was seen in neurites and cell bodies of neurons. In addition, the network and detailed structure of neurites were visible in dissociated and slice cultures of hypothalamic neurons. We examined the effect of oestrogen deprivation by ovariectomy on the structure of the GFP-positive neurons. The area of ERalpha-positive cell bodies in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and MPO was measured by capturing the GFP signal and was found to be significantly smaller in ovariectomy mice than in control mice.

To illuminate the function of EphA4 in RGC cell fate determination during early corticogenesis, we deleted Epha4 in cortical cells at E11.5 or E13.5. Loss of EphA4 at both stages led to precocious in vivo RGC differentiation toward neurogenesis. Cortical cells isolated at E14.5 and E15.5 from both deletion mutants showed reduced capacity for neurosphere formation with greater differentiation toward neurons. They also exhibited lower phosphorylation of ERK and FRS2alpha in the presence of FGF. The size of the cerebral cortex at P0 was smaller than that of controls when Epha4 was deleted at E11.5 but not when it was deleted at E13.5, although the cortical layers were formed normally in both mutants. The number of PAX6-positive RGCs decreased at later developmental stages only in the E11.5 Epha4 deletion mutant. These results suggest that EphA4, in cooperation with an FGF signal, contributes to the maintenance of RGC self-renewal and repression of RGC differentiation through the neuronal lineage.

This analysis uncovered a global redirection in the target genes controlled by ERalpha, ERRalpha, and their coactivator AIB1, defining a novel set of target genes in tamoxifen-resistant cells. Beyond differences in the ERalpha and ERRalpha target gene repertoires, both factors were engaged in similar pathobiologic processes relevant to acquired resistance.

The MOE consists of four types of cells: olfactory sensory neurons, supporting cells, basal cells, and microvillous cells. Among these, development and function of microvillous cells remain largely unknown. Recent studies have shown that a population of microvillous cells expresses the monovalent cation channel Trpm5 (transient receptor potential channel M5). To examine functional differentiation of Trpm5-expressing microvillous cells in the MOE, we investigated the expression and function of Skn-1a, a POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) transcription factor required for functional differentiation of Trpm5-expressing sweet, umami, and bitter taste bud cells in oropharyngeal epithelium and solitary chemosensory cells in nasal respiratory epithelium. RESULTS: Skn-1a is expressed in a subset of basal cells and apical non-neuronal cells in the MOE of embryonic and adult mice. Two-color in situ hybridization revealed that a small population of Skn-1a-expressing cells was co-labeled with Mash1/Ascl1 and that most Skn-1a-expressing cells coexpress Trpm5. To investigate whether Skn-1a has an irreplaceable role in the MOE, we analyzed Skn-1a-deficient mice. In the absence of Skn-1a, olfactory sensory neurons differentiate normally except for a limited defect in terminal differentiation in ectoturbinate 2 of some of MOEs examined. In contrast, the impact of Skn-1a deficiency on Trpm5-expressing microvillous cells is much more striking: Trpm5, villin, and choline acetyltransferase, cell markers previously shown to identify Trpm5-expressing microvillous cells, were no longer detectable in Skn-1a-deficient mice. In addition, quantitative analysis demonstrated that the density of superficial microvillous cells was significantly decreased in Skn-1a-deficient mice. CONCLUSION: Skn-1a is expressed in a minority of Mash1-positive olfactory progenitor cells and a majority of Trpm5-expressing microvillous cells in the main olfactory epithelium. Loss-of-function mutation of Skn-1a resulted in complete loss of Trpm5-expressing microvillous cells, whereas most of olfactory sensory neurons differentiated normally.

By contrast, beta-catenin activation a day later within Shh(+) placodes, expands taste bud precursors directly, but enlarges papillae indirectly. Further, placodal activation of beta-catenin drives precocious differentiation of Type I glial-like taste cells, but not other taste cell types. Later activation of beta-catenin within Shh(+) precursors during papilla morphogenesis also expands taste bud precursors and accelerates Type I cell differentiation, but papilla size is no longer enhanced.

Ligands for sigmaR1, such as (+)-pentazocine [(+)-PTZ], confer marked retinal neuroprotection in vivo and in vitro. Recently we analyzed the retinal phenotype of mice lacking sigmaR1 (sigmaR1 KO) and observed normal retinal morphology and function in young mice (5-30 weeks) but diminished negative scotopic threshold responses (nSTRs), retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss, and disruption of optic nerve axons consistent with inner retinal dysfunction by 1 year. These data led us to test the hypothesis that sigmaR1 may be critical in forestalling chronic retinal stress; diabetes was used as the model of chronic stress. METHODS: To determine whether sigmaR1 is required for (+)-PTZ neuroprotective effects, primary RGCs isolated from wild-type (WT) and sigmaR1 KO mice were exposed to xanthine-xanthine oxidase (10 microM:2 mU/ml) to induce oxidative stress in the presence or absence of (+)-PTZ. Cell death was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis. To assess effects of chronic stress on RGC function, diabetes was induced in 3-week C57BL/6 (WT) and sigmaR1 KO mice, using streptozotocin to yield four groups: WT nondiabetic (WT non-DB), WT diabetic (WT-DB), sigmaR1 KO non-DB, and sigmaR1 KO-DB. After 12 weeks of diabetes, when mice were 15-weeks old, intraocular pressure (IOP) was recorded, electrophysiologic testing was performed (including detection of nSTRs), and the number of RGCs was counted in retinal histological sections. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that (+)-PTZ could not prevent oxidative stress-induced death of RGCs harvested from sigmaR1 KO mice but afforded robust protection against death of RGCs harvested from WT mice. In the studies of chronic stress induced by diabetes, the IOP measured in the four mouse groups was within the normal range; however, there was a significant increase in the IOP of sigmaR1 KO-DB mice (16 +/- 0.5 mmHg) compared to the other groups tested (sigmaR1 KO non-DB, WT non-DB, WT-DB: ~12 +/- 0.6 mmHg). Regarding electrophysiologic testing, the nSTRs of sigmaR1 KO non-DB mice were similar to WT non-DB mice at 15 weeks; however, they were significantly lower in sigmaR1 KO-DB mice (5 +/- 1 microV) compared to the other groups, including, notably, sigmaR1 KO-nonDB (12+/-2 microV). As expected, the number of RGCs in sigmaR1 KO non-DB mice was similar to WT non-DB mice at 15 weeks, but under chronic stress of diabetes there were fewer RGCs in retinas of sigmaR1 KO-DB mice. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing unequivocally that the neuroprotective effects of (+)-PTZ require sigmaR1. sigmaR1 KO mice show normal retinal structure and function at young ages; however, when subjected to the chronic stress of diabetes, there is an acceleration of retinal functional deficits in sigmaR1 KO mice such that ganglion cell dysfunction is observed at a much earlier age than nondiabetic sigmaR1 KO mice.

Motor neuron-derived agrin activates MuSK via binding to MuSK's coreceptor Lrp4, and genetic defects in agrin underlie a congenital myasthenic syndrome (an NMJ disorder). However, MuSK-dependent postsynaptic differentiation of NMJs occurs in the absence of a motor neuron, indicating a need for nerve/agrin-independent MuSK activation. We previously identified the muscle protein Dok-7 as an essential activator of MuSK. Although NMJ formation requires agrin under physiological conditions, it is dispensable for NMJ formation experimentally in the absence of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which inhibits postsynaptic specialization. Thus, it was hypothesized that MuSK needs agrin together with Lrp4 and Dok-7 to achieve sufficient activation to surmount inhibition by acetylcholine. Here, we show that forced expression of Dok-7 in muscle enhanced MuSK activation in mice lacking agrin or Lrp4 and restored midmuscle NMJ formation in agrin-deficient mice, but not in Lrp4-deficient mice, probably due to the loss of Lrp4-dependent presynaptic differentiation.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a mouse chromosome substitution strain (CSS-14) that carries an SWR/J chromosome 14 on a C57BL/10J genetic background and, like Ecl, exhibits circling behavior due to lateral semicircular canal malformation. We utilized CSS-14 to identify the chromosome 14 Ecl gene by positional cloning. Our candidate interval is located upstream of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) and contains an inner ear-specific, long non-coding RNA that we have designated Rubie (RNA upstream of Bmp4 expressed in inner ear). Rubie is spliced and polyadenylated, and is expressed in developing semicircular canals. However, we discovered that the SWR/J allele of Rubie is disrupted by an intronic endogenous retrovirus that causes aberrant splicing and premature polyadenylation of the transcript. Rubie lies in the conserved gene desert upstream of Bmp4, within a region previously shown to be important for inner ear expression of Bmp4. We found that the expression patterns of Bmp4 and Rubie are nearly identical in developing inner ears. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these results and previous studies showing that Bmp4 is essential for proper vestibular development, we propose that Rubie is the gene mutated in Ecl mice, that it is involved in regulating inner ear expression of Bmp4, and that aberrant Bmp4 expression contributes to the Ecl phenotype.", "publish_time": "2012-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"compound": 3, "other diagram": 3, "light microscopy": 13, "gel/blot": 9, "3D structure": 1, "fluorescence": 4, "macromolecule sequence": 6}}, "6099272": {"cord_uid": "6099272", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Genomic analysis of reactive astrogliosis.", "abstract": "Reactive astrogliosis is characterized by a profound change in astrocyte phenotype in response to all CNS injuries and diseases. To better understand the reactive astrocyte state, we used Affymetrix GeneChip arrays to profile gene expression in populations of reactive astrocytes isolated at various time points after induction using two mouse injury models, ischemic stroke and neuroinflammation. We find reactive gliosis consists of a rapid, but quickly attenuated, induction of gene expression after insult and identify induced Lcn2 and Serpina3n as strong markers of reactive astrocytes. Strikingly, reactive astrocyte phenotype strongly depended on the type of inducing injury. Although there is a core set of genes that is upregulated in reactive astrocytes from both injury models, at least 50% of the altered gene expression is specific to a given injury type. Reactive astrocytes in ischemia exhibited a molecular phenotype that suggests that they may be beneficial or protective, whereas reactive astrocytes induced by LPS exhibited a phenotype that suggests that they may be detrimental. These findings demonstrate that, despite well established commonalities, astrocyte reactive gliosis is a highly heterogeneous state in which astrocyte activities are altered to respond to the specific injury.

In this study we overcame these problems by using murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), a virus genetically and biologically related to EBV.

These neurons originate in the nasal placode and migrate during embryonic development, in association with olfactory/vomeronasal nerves, first in the nose, then through the cribriform plate to enter the forebrain, before settling in the hypothalamus. One of the molecules required for their early migration in the nose is the chemokine CXCL12, which is expressed in the embryonic nasal mesenchyme in an increasing ventral to dorsal gradient, presumably guiding GnRH neurons toward the forebrain. Mice lacking CXCR4, the receptor for CXCL12, exhibit defective GnRH cell movement and a significant reduction in their number, suggesting that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling is important in the migration and survival of these neurons. Here, we investigated the role of the more recently identified second CXCL12 receptor, CXCR7, in GnRH neuron development. We demonstrate that CXCR7 is expressed along the migratory path of GnRH neurons in the nasal cavity and, although not expressed by GnRH neurons, it affects their migration as indicated by the ectopic accumulation of these cells in the nasal compartment in CXCR7(-/-) mice.

This undersulfation correlated with the chondroitin synthesis rate measured via radioactive sulfate incorporation, explaining the sulfation normalization with age. Collagen orientation was reduced, and the reduction correlated with chondroitin undersulfation. Such disorientation involved the layer of collagen covering the articular surface and protecting cartilage from degradation.

The effect of MCP-1 was not dependent on the activation of its receptor CCR2, while it was blocked by flumazenil, the antagonist of benzodiazepine sites. Analysis of GABAA receptor subunit composition has indicated an altered subunit expression level in G93A cortical neurons compared to controls. Instead, in cultured spinal neurons MCP-1 induced a significant reduction of GABA-evoked currents, also through the benzodiazepine sites, indicating a region-specific mechanism of action.

These findings provide the first evidence that MCP-1, acting on benzodiazepine sites, can modulate the GABA-evoked currents, depending on the subunit composition of GABA(A) receptor. In cortical neurons MCP-1 upmodulates the GABA-evoked current and this effect is exacerbated in the mutated neurons.

Corneal opacity defined as granular and lattice deposits was observed in 45.0% of homozygotes, 19.4% of heterozygotes. The incidence of corneal opacity was significantly higher in homozygotes than in heterozygotes (p = 0.02). Histology of affected mice was similar to histology of human disease.

By integrating gene-targeted mouse and computational models, we have identified an indispensable role for ventricular Mlc2 (Mlc2v) phosphorylation in regulating cardiac muscle contraction. Cardiac myosin cycling kinetics, which directly control actin-myosin interactions, were directly affected, but surprisingly, Mlc2v phosphorylation also fed back to cooperatively influence calcium-dependent activation of the thin filament. Loss of these mechanisms produced early defects in the rate of cardiac muscle twitch relaxation and ventricular torsion. Strikingly, these defects preceded the left ventricular dysfunction of heart disease and failure in a mouse model with nonphosphorylatable Mlc2v.

Indeed, defects in dendritic arborization are associated with human neurodevelopmental disorders. The molecular mechanisms regulating dendritic arbor complexity, however, are still poorly understood. Here, we uncover the molecular basis for the regulation of dendritic branching during cortical development. We show that during development, dendritic branching requires post-mitotic suppression of the RhoGTPase Cdc42. By generating genetically modified mice, we demonstrate that this is catalyzed in vivo by the novel Cdc42-GAP NOMA-GAP. Loss of NOMA-GAP leads to decreased neocortical volume, associated specifically with profound oversimplification of cortical dendritic arborization and hyperactivation of Cdc42. Remarkably, dendritic complexity and cortical thickness can be partially restored by genetic reduction of post-mitotic Cdc42 levels. Furthermore, we identify the actin regulator cofilin as a key regulator of dendritic complexity in vivo.

We have identified a female child with an isolated left-sided posterolateral CDH covered by a membranous sac who had no features suggestive of BNAR or MOTA syndromes. This child carries a maternally-inherited approximately 86 kb FREM1 deletion that affects the expression of FREM1's full-length transcripts and a paternally-inherited splice site mutation that causes activation of a cryptic splice site, leading to a shift in the reading frame and premature termination of all forms of the FREM1 protein. This suggests that recessive FREM1 mutations can cause isolated CDH in humans. Further evidence for the role of FREM1 in the development of CDH comes from an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea -derived mouse strain, eyes2, which has a homozygous truncating mutation in Frem1. Frem1(eyes2) mice have eye defects, renal agenesis and develop retrosternal diaphragmatic hernias which are covered by a membranous sac. We confirmed that Frem1 is expressed in the anterior portion of the developing diaphragm and found that Frem1(eyes2) embryos had decreased levels of cell proliferation in their developing diaphragms when compared to wild-type embryos.

Light-induced stimulation of BFc axons produced different effects depending on the BLA cell type. In late-firing interneurons, BFc inputs elicited fast nicotinic EPSPs.

When principal BLA neurons were quiescent or made to fire at low rates by depolarizing current injection, light-induced activation of BFc axons elicited muscarinic IPSPs. In contrast, with stronger depolarizing currents, eliciting firing above approximately 6-8 Hz, these muscarinic IPSPs lost their efficacy because stimulation of BFc inputs prolonged current-evoked afterdepolarizations.

However, ADAM17 also sheds numerous other ligands, thus implicating ADAM17 in additional molecular pathways. The goal of this study was to experimentally establish the role of ADAM17 and determine ADAM17-mediated pathways essential for the embryonic eyelid closure. METHODS: Wild-type (WT) and woe mice, carrying a hypomorphic mutation in Adam17, were evaluated using H&E and scanning electron microscopy. Expressions of ADAM17, EGFR, and the phosphorylated form EGFR-P were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. BrdU and TUNEL assays were used to evaluate cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. In vitro scratch assays of primary cultures were used to evaluate cell migration. Clinical and histologic analyses established if the hypermorphic Egfr(Dsk5) allele can rescue the woe embryonic eyelid closure. RESULTS: woe mice exhibited a failure to develop the leading edge of the eyelid and consequently failure of the embryonic eyelid closure. Expression of ADAM17 was identified in the eyelid epithelium in the cells of the leading edge. ADAM17 is essential for epithelial cell migration, but does not play a role in proliferation and apoptosis. EGFR was expressed in both WT and woe eyelid epithelium, but the phosphorylated EGFR-P form was detected only in WT.

Increased accumulation of less organized intimal collagen, laminin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and matrix-rich fibrosis was also apparent in lesions of the mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Although atherogenesis is accelerated in global COX-2 knockouts, consistent with evidence of risk transformation during chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration, this masks the contrasting effects of enzyme depletion in macrophages versus vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells.

CaSR activation stimulated PTHrP production by breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo Tissue-specific disruption of the casr gene in mammary epithelial cells in MMTV-PymT mice reduced tumor PTHrP expression and inhibited tumor cell proliferation and tumor outgrowth. CaSR signaling promoted the proliferation of human breast cancer cell lines and tumor cells cultured from MMTV-PyMT mice.

HtrA1 is expressed by Tpbpa-positive trophoblast precursors in the outer ectoplacental cone and junctional zone from embryonic day 7.5 to 10.5.

OBJECTIVE: To establish the role of RBM20 in the formation of circRNAs in the heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we performed circRNA profiling on ribosomal depleted RNA from human hearts and identified the expression of thousands of circRNAs, with some of them regulated in disease. Interestingly, we identified 80 circRNAs to be expressed from the titin gene, a gene that is known to undergo highly complex alternative splicing. We show that some of these circRNAs are dynamically regulated in dilated cardiomyopathy but not in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We generated RBM20-null mice and show that they completely lack these titin circRNAs. In addition, in a cardiac sample from an RBM20 mutation carrier, titin circRNA production was severely altered. Interestingly, the loss of RBM20 caused only a specific subset of titin circRNAs to be lost. These circRNAs originated from the RBM20-regulated I-band region of the titin transcript. CONCLUSIONS: We show that RBM20 is crucial for the formation of a subset of circRNAs that originate from the I-band of the titin gene.

RESULTS: First, we systematically analyzed by immunohistofluorescence, the SV2A, SV2B and SV2C expression during mouse brain development, from embryonic day 12 (E12) to P30. This semi-quantitative approach suggests a modulation of SV2A and SV2B expression in hippocampus around P7. This is the reason why we used various quantitative approaches (laser microdissection of whole hippocampus followed by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis) indicating that SV2A and SV2B expression increased between P5 and P7 and remained stable between P7 and P10. Moreover, the increase of SV2A expression in the hippocampus at P7 was mainly observed in the CA1 region while SV2B expression in this region remains stable. CONCLUSIONS: The observed alterations of SV2A expression in hippocampus are consistent with the appearance of seizures in SV2A-/- animals at early postnatal age and the hypothesis that SV2A absence favors epileptic seizures around P7.", "publish_time": "2013-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 4, "other diagram": 9, "fluorescence": 10, "gel/blot": 2}}, "5426740": {"cord_uid": "5426740", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Ciliary neurotrophic factor stimulates tyrosine hydroxylase activity.", "abstract": "Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in norepinephrine synthesis, and its expression and activity are regulated by many factors in sympathetic neurons.

MID2, a homolog of MID1, shares high structural and functional similarities with MID1. Identification of a missense mutation in MID2 in an Indian family causing overlapping phenotypes with OS provided the first evidence that MID2 might be involved in similar pathogenesis.

Real-time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization were used in the expression studies of Mid1/Mid2 in mouse embryos. RESULTS: Up-to-date, 88 different mutations have been identified in MID1 and most mutations occurred on the conserved amino acids of MID1 and MID2. Expression studies using real-time RT-PCR implicated a tendency of a mutually repressive expression pattern between Mid1 and Mid2 in mouse embryos.

Foxo1 is important to maintain adult beta-cells, but little is known about its role in pancreatic progenitor cells as determinants of future beta-cell function. We addressed this question by generating an allelic series of somatic Foxo1 knockouts at different stages of pancreatic development in mice. Surprisingly, ablation of Foxo1 in pancreatic progenitors resulted in delayed appearance of Neurogenin3(+) progenitors and their persistence into adulthood as a self-replicating pool, causing a fourfold increase of beta-cell mass. Similarly, Foxo1 ablation in endocrine progenitors increased their numbers, extended their survival, and expanded beta-cell mass. In contrast, ablation of Foxo1 in terminally differentiated beta-cells did not increase beta-cell mass nor did it affect Neurogenin3 expression. Despite the increased beta-cell mass, islets from mice lacking Foxo1 in pancreatic or endocrine progenitors responded poorly to glucose, resulting in glucose intolerance. We conclude that Foxo1 integrates cues that determine developmental timing, pool size, and functional features of endocrine progenitor cells, resulting in a legacy effect on adult beta-cell mass and function.

Both forms of tonic currents are differentially expressed in D1+ and D2+ MSNs. This study extends these findings by relating presynaptic activation with pharmacological analysis of inhibitory conductance in mice where the beta3 subunit is conditionally removed in fluorescently labeled D2+ MSNs and in mice with global deletion of the delta subunit. Our results show that responses to low doses of gaboxadol (2 muM), a GABAA receptor agonist with preference to delta subunit, are abolished in the delta but not the beta3 subunit knock out mice. This suggests that the beta3 subunit is not a component of the adult extrasynaptic receptor pool, in contrast to what has been shown for tonic current in young mice. Deletion of the beta3 subunit from D2+ MSNs however, removed slow spontaneous IPSCs, implicating its role in mediating synaptic input from striatal neurogliaform interneurons.", "publish_time": "2013-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 1, "3D structure": 4, "gel/blot": 2}}, "5695703": {"cord_uid": "5695703", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Simultaneous deletion of the methylcytosine oxidases Tet1 and Tet3 increases transcriptome variability in early embryogenesis.", "abstract": "Dioxygenases of the TET (Ten-Eleven Translocation) family produce oxidized methylcytosines, intermediates in DNA demethylation, as well as new epigenetic marks.

However, the extent to which an RPC can re-adjust its inherent program and the mechanisms through which the expression of a particular bHLH factor influences RPC fate is unclear. Previously, we have shown that Neurod1 inserted into the Atoh7 locus activates the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) program in Atoh7-expressing RPCs but not in Neurod1-expressing RPCs, suggesting that Atoh7-expressing RPCs are not able to adopt the cell fate determined by Neurod1, but rather are pre-programmed to produce RGCs. Here, we show that Neurod1-expressing RPCs, which are destined to produce amacrine and photoreceptor cells, can be re-programmed into RGCs when Atoh7 is inserted into the Neurod1 locus. These results suggest that Atoh7 acts dominantly to convert a RPC subpopulation not destined for an RGC fate to adopt that fate.

Phosphorylated CRTCs are sequestered in the cytoplasm, but rapidly dephosphorylated and translocated into the nucleus following a stressful stimulus. As the stress response is attenuated by oxytocin (OT), we tested whether OT interferes with CRTC translocation and, thereby, Crf expression. OT (1 nmol, i.c.v.) delayed the stress-induced increase of nuclear CRTC3 and Crf hnRNA levels in the paraventricular nucleus of male rats and mice, but did not affect either parameter in the absence of the stressor. The increase in Crf hnRNA levels at later time points was parallel to elevated nuclear CRTC2/3 levels. A direct effect of Thr(4) Gly(7)-OT (TGOT) on CRTC3 translocation and Crf expression was found in rat primary hypothalamic neurons, amygdaloid (Ar-5), hypothalamic (H32), and human neuroblastoma (Be(2)M17) cell lines. CRTC3, but not CRCT2, knockdown using siRNA in Be(2)M17 cells prevented the effect of TGOT on Crf hnRNA levels. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that TGOT reduced CRTC3, but not CRTC2, binding to the Crf promoter after 10 min of forskolin stimulation. Together, the results indicate that OT modulates CRTC3 translocation, the binding of CRTC3 to the Crf promoter and, ultimately, transcription of the Crf gene.

In this study we show that activation of the oxytocin receptor in the paraventricular nucleus delays transcription of the gene encoding corticotropin releasing factor (Crf), the main regulator of the stress response. It does so by sequestering the coactivator of the transcription factor CREB, CRTC3, in the cytosol, resulting in reduced binding of CRTC3 to the Crf gene promoter and subsequent Crf gene expression.

Transformed COX-2+/+ and COX-2-/- keratinocytes expressed similar levels of H-ras, epidermal growth factor receptor and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in vitro; and COX-2-deficiency did not reduce uninfected or v-H-ras infected keratinocyte replication.

Two factors appeared to account for the reduced papilloma size. First, papillomas derived from COX-2-/- keratinocytes showed about 70% decreased proliferation, as measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, compared with papillomas derived from COX-2+/+ keratinocytes. Second, keratin 1 immunostaining of papillomas indicated that COX-2-/- keratinocytes prematurely initiated terminal differentiation. Differences in the levels of apoptosis and vascularization did not appear to be contributing factors as their levels were similar in tumors derived from COX-2-/- and COX-2+/+ keratinocytes. Overall, the data are in agreement with our previous observations that decreased papilloma number and size on COX-2-/- mice resulted from reduced keratinocyte proliferation and accelerated keratinocyte differentiation.

Here, we show that despite disruption of the CpG island by the COIN module intron, the COIN allele of Sox2 (Sox2(COIN)) is phenotypically wild type, and also does not interfere with expression of Sox2Ot and miR1897. Furthermore, the inverted COIN allele of Sox2, Sox2(INV) is functionally null, as homozygotes recapitulate the phenotype of Sox2(betageo/betageo) mice, a well-characterized Sox2 null. Lastly, the benefit of the eGFP marker embedded in the COIN allele is demonstrated as it mirrors the expression pattern of Sox2. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate the applicability of the COIN technology as a method of choice for targeting single exon genes.", "publish_time": "2012-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 1, "fluorescence": 6, "macromolecule sequence": 2, "3D structure": 1}}, "5546521": {"cord_uid": "5546521", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Recall and reconsolidation of contextual fear memory: differential control by ERK and Zif268 expression dosage.", "abstract": "Compelling evidence points to the existence of independent cellular processes involved in the consolidation and reconsolidation of memory. For instance, a double dissociation has been reported between hippocampal Extracellular-Regulated Kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) activity being necessary for contextual fear conditioning (CFC) consolidation but not reconsolidation. Conversely, hippocampal expression of the immediate early gene Zif268 is necessary for CFC reconsolidation but not consolidation. Since we previously reported that ERK1/2 controls the transcription of Zif268 in the hippocampus, we examined the precise role of ERK1/2 activity and Zif268 gene expression dosage in CFC memory processing. For this, we first assessed performance of Zif268 homozygous and heterozygous mutant mice in a CFC paradigm. Whereas Zif268-/- mice displayed a deficit of both consolidation and reconsolidation, Zif268+/- mice displayed a selective deficit of reconsolidation only, therefore pointing to the relationship between Zif268 gene expression dosage and CFC memory processing. Zif268 gene expression dosage interfered with the reconsolidation process if and only if CFC memory was relatively recently encoded and directly reactivated. Furthermore, CFC memory strengthening previously reported to involve Zif268 expression in the hippocampus was spared in Zif268+/- mice. Finally, blocking ERK1/2 activity prior to CFC retrieval prevented the deficit of reconsolidation observed in Zif268+/- mice. Collectively, these results highlight a tight relationship between Zif268 gene expression dosage and CFC memory processing. They also suggest that ERK1/2 activity upon CFC memory recall is necessary for its retrieval, a prerequisite for its reactivation and subsequent reconsolidation.", "publish_time": "2013-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"3D structure": 6, "gel/blot": 3}}, "5806369": {"cord_uid": "5806369", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Developing HSCs become Notch independent by the end of maturation in the AGM region.", "abstract": "The first definitive hematopoietic stem cells (dHSCs) in the mouse emerge in the dorsal aorta of the embryonic day (E) 10.5 to 11 aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region.

In the present study, we examined the role of N-cadherin in ENS development and the interplay with beta1 integrins during this process. The Ht-PA-Cre mouse model was used to target gene disruption of N-cadherin and beta1 integrin in migratory NCC and to produce single- and double-conditional mutants for these two types of adhesion receptors. Double mutation of N-cadherin and beta1 integrin led to embryonic lethality with severe defects in ENS development. N-cadherin-null (Ncad-/-) ENCC exhibited a delayed colonization in the developing gut at E12.5, although this was to a lesser extent than in beta1-/- mutants. This delay of Ncad-/- ENCC migration was recovered at later stages of development. The double Ncad-/-; beta1-/- mutant ENCC failed to colonize the distal part of the gut and there was more severe aganglionosis in the proximal hindgut than in the single mutants for N-cadherin or beta1-integrin. This was due to an altered speed of locomotion and directionality in the gut wall.

To address this question, we have generated Cyp26b1/Stra8 double knockout (dKO) embryos. We successfully suppressed the induction of meiosis in CYP26B1-null XY germ cells by removing the Stra8 gene.

RESULTS: Here, we utilize axonally targeted transgenic reporter mice to visualize genetically distinct dorsal interneuron (dI)1 and dI4 commissural axons and show that the repulsive class 3 semaphorin (Sema3) guidance receptor Neuropilin 2 (Npn2), is selectively expressed on the dI1 population and is required for the guidance of post-crossing dI1, but not dI4, axons. Consistent with these observations, the midline-associated Npn2 ligands, Sema3F and Sema3B, promote the collapse of dI1, but not dI4, axon-associated growth cones in vitro.

Free fatty acids generated by lipophagy from the breakdown of TGs fuel cellular rates of mitochondrial beta-oxidation. Lipophagy therefore functions to regulate intracellular lipid stores, cellular levels of free lipids such as fatty acids and energy homeostasis.

These data indicate that homotypic vascular smooth muscle cell interactions are required for proper contractile smooth muscle cell differentiation and postnatal closure of the ductus arteriosus in mice. genesis 54:86-90, 2016.

As predicted, TGFbeta2 was high in four MMTV-Hoxb7/Her2 transgenic mouse tumor cell lines and two breast cancer cell lines transfected with HOXB7, whereas TGFbeta2 was low in HOXB7-depleted cells. HOXB7 directly bound to and activated the TGFbeta2 promoter in luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Increased migration and invasion as a result of HOXB7 overexpression in breast cancer cells were reversed by knockdown of TGFbeta2 or pharmacologic inhibition of TGFbeta signaling. Furthermore, knockdown of TGFbeta2 in HOXB7-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells dramatically inhibited metastasis to the lung. Interestingly, HOXB7 overexpression also induced tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment and acquisition of an M2 tumor-promoting phenotype. TGFbeta2 mediated HOXB7-induced activation of macrophages, suggesting that TAMs may contribute to HOXB7-promoted tumor metastasis. Providing clinical relevance to these findings, by real-time PCR analysis, there was a strong correlation between HOXB7 and TGFbeta2 expression in primary breast carcinomas.

Lineage-tracing and functional studies have shown that trunk NCCs migrate along two distinct paths that correlate with different developmental fates. Thus, NCCs migrating ventrally through the anterior somite form sympathetic and sensory ganglia, whereas NCCs migrating dorsolaterally form melanocytes. Although the mechanisms promoting migration along the dorsolateral path are well defined, the molecules providing positional identity to sympathetic and sensory-fated NCCs that migrate along the same ventral path are ill defined. Neuropilins (Nrp1 and Nrp2) are transmembrane glycoproteins that are essential for NCC migration. Nrp1 and Nrp2 knockout mice have disparate phenotypes, suggesting that these receptors may play a role in sorting NCCs biased towards sensory and sympathetic fates to appropriate locations. RESULTS: Here we have combined in situ hybridisation, immunohistochemistry and lineage-tracing analyses to demonstrate that neuropilins are expressed in a non-overlapping pattern within NCCs. Whereas Nrp1 is expressed in NCCs emigrating from hindbrain rhombomere 4 (r4) and within trunk NCCs giving rise to sympathetic and sensory ganglia, Nrp2 is preferentially expressed in NCCs emigrating from r2 and in trunk NCCs giving rise to sensory ganglia. By generating a tamoxifen-inducible lineage-tracing system, we further demonstrate that Nrp2-expressing NCCs specifically populate sensory ganglia including the trigeminal ganglia (V) in the head and the dorsal root ganglia in the trunk. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results demonstrate that Nrp1 and Nrp2 are expressed in different populations of NCCs, and that Nrp2-expressing NCCs are strongly biased towards a sensory fate. In the trunk, Nrp2-expressing NCCs specifically give rise to sensory ganglia, whereas Nrp1-expressing NCCs likely give rise to both sensory and sympathetic ganglia.

The current study examined the relationship between spatial cognition and protein-protein interactions of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in frontal cortex crude synaptosome from 3, 12, and 26-month-old C57BL/6 mice.

This pathology is associated with an increased production of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species. The aim of this work was to study the alterations in NF-kappaB activation and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression induced by membrane depolarization in dystrophic mdx myotubes. Membrane depolarization elicited by electrical stimulation increased p65 phosphorylation, NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and NF-kappaB-dependent IL-6 expression in wt myotubes, whereas in mdx myotubes it had the opposite effect. We have previously shown that depolarization-induced intracellular Ca2+ increases and ROS production are necessary for NF-kappaB activation and stimulation of gene expression in wt myotubes. Dystrophic myotubes showed a reduced amplitude and area under the curve of the Ca2+ transient elicited by electrical stimulation. On the other hand, electrical stimuli induced higher ROS production in mdx than wt myotubes, which were blocked by NOX2 inhibitors. Moreover, mRNA expression and protein levels of the NADPH oxidase subunits: p47phox and gp91phox were increased in mdx myotubes. Looking at ROS-dependence of NF-kappaB activation we found that in wt myotubes external administration of 50 muM H2O2 increased NF-kappaB activity; after administration of 100 and 200 muM H2O2 there was no effect. In mdx myotubes there was a dose-dependent reduction in NF-kappaB activity in response to external administration of H2O2, with a significant effect of 100 muM and 200 muM, suggesting that ROS levels are critical for NF-kappaB activity. Prior blockage with NOX2 inhibitors blunted the effects of electrical stimuli in both NF-kappaB activation and IL-6 expression. Finally, to ascertain whether stimulation of NF-kappaB and IL-6 gene expression by the inflammatory pathway is also impaired in mdx myotubes, we studied the effect of lipopolysaccharide on both NF-kappaB activation and IL-6 expression. Exposure to lipopolysaccharide induced a dramatic increase in both NF-kappaB activation and IL-6 expression in both wt and mdx myotubes, suggesting that the altered IL-6 gene expression after electrical stimulation in mdx muscle cells is due to dysregulation of Ca2+ release and ROS production, both of which impinge on NF-kappaB signaling.

IP3R2 plays a crucial role in the function of secretory cell types (e.g. pancreatic acinar cells, hepatocytes, salivary gland, eccrine sweat gland).

However, as Gli3 is widely expressed during critical stages of forebrain development, the precise temporal and spatial requirements for Gli3 function in callosal development remain unclear. Here, we used a conditional mouse mutant approach to inactivate Gli3 in specific regions of the developing telencephalon in order to delineate the domain(s) in which Gli3 is required for normal development of the corpus callosum. Inactivation of Gli3 in the septum or in the medial ganglionic eminence had no effect on CC formation, however Gli3 inactivation in the developing cerebral cortex led to the formation of a severely hypoplastic CC at E18.5 due to a severe disorganization of midline guideposts.

As of yet, a common mediator of these two pathways has not been identified. Microtubule dynamics is responsible for several key processes after CNS injuries: intracellular trafficking of receptors for neurotrophic factors, axonal retraction by inhibitory factors, and secondary tissue damages by inflammation and scarring. Kinases regulating microtubule organization, such as Cdk5 or GSK3beta, may play pivotal roles during CNS recovery, but the molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) stabilizes cytoskeletal polymerization, while CRMP2 phosphorylation by Cdk5 and GSK3beta loses its affinity for cytoskeleton proteins, leading to the inhibition of axonal growth. Here, we characterized CRMP2 phosphorylation as the first crucial factor regulating neurotrophic and inhibitory responses after spinal cord injury (SCI). We found that pharmacological inhibition of GSK3beta enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced axonal growth response in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. DRG neurons from CRMP2 knock-in (Crmp2KI/KI) mice, where CRMP2 phosphorylation was eliminated, showed elevated sensitivity to BDNF as well. Additionally, cultured Crmp2KI/KI neurons exhibited suppressed axonal growth inhibition by chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG). These data suggest a couple of new molecular insights: the BDNF/GSK3beta/CRMP2 and CSPG/GSK3beta/CRMP2 pathways. Next, we tested the significance of CRMP2 phosphorylation after CNS injury in vivo. The phosphorylation level of CRMP2 was enhanced in the injured spinal cord. Crmp2KI/KI mice exhibited prominent recovery of locomotive and nociceptive functions after SCI, which correlated with the enhanced axonal growth of the motor and sensory neurons.

In the past several years a plethora of papers has indicated a crucial role for primary cilia in the development of a wide variety of organs. We have investigated heart development in cobblestone, a hypomorphic allele of the gene encoding the intraflagellar transport protein Ift88, and uncovered a number of the most common congenital heart defects seen in newborn humans. METHODS: We generated serial sections of mutant cobblestone and wild type embryos in the region encompassing the heart and the cardiac outflow tract. The sections were further processed to generate three-dimensional reconstructions of these structures, and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and in situ hybridization were used to examine signal transduction pathways in the relevant areas. Whole mount in situ hybridization was also employed for certain developmental markers. RESULTS: In addition to an enlarged pericardium and failure of both ventricular and atrial septum formation, the cobblestone mutants displayed manifold defects in outflow tract formation, including persistent truncus arteriosus, an overriding aorta, and abnormal transformation of the aortic arches. To discern the basis of these anomalies we examined both the maintenance of primary cilia as well as endogenous and migratory embryonic cell populations that contribute to the outflow tract and atrioventricular septa. The colonization of the embryonic heart by cardiac neural crest occurred normally in the cobblestone mutant, as did the expression of Sonic hedgehog. However, with the loss of primary cilia in the mutant hearts, there was a loss of both downstream Sonic hedgehog signaling and of Islet 1 expression in the second heart field, a derivative of the pharyngeal mesoderm. In addition, defects were recorded in development of atrial laterality and ventricular myocardiogenesis. Finally, we observed a reduction in expression of Bmp4 in the outflow tract, and complete loss of expression of both Bmp2 and Bmp4 in the atrioventricular endocardial cushions. Loss of BMP2/4 signaling may result in the observed proliferative defect in the endocardial cushions, which give rise to both the atrioventricular septa as well as to the septation of the outflow tract. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results potentially identify a novel link between Sonic hedgehog signaling at the primary cilium and BMP-dependent effects upon cardiogenesis.

We found APP protein significantly increased in the hippocampus of aged SAMP8 mice. The 20 to 25 nucleotide (nt) tiny regulators, known as micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs), have been found to play crucial roles in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we examined the post-transcriptional regulation mechanism of APP mediated by micro ribonucleic acids and found that miR-16 was one of the post-transcriptional regulators of APP in SAMP8 mice. Overexpression of miR-16, both in vitro and in vivo, led to reduced APP protein expression. Furthermore, miR-16 and APP displayed complementary expression patterns in SAMP8 mice and BALb/c mice embryos. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that APP is a target of miR-16 and the abnormally low expression of miR-16 could potentially lead to APP protein accumulation in AD mice.", "publish_time": "2012-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 12, "gel/blot": 3, "macromolecule sequence": 9, "fluorescence": 12, "other diagram": 6}}, "5780920": {"cord_uid": "5780920", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "TCF1 links GIPR signaling to the control of beta cell function and survival.", "abstract": "The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor transduce nutrient-stimulated signals to control beta cell function.

As an initial step in determining the mechanisms involved, we investigated the expression patterns of genes critical for 5-HT system function in mouse extraembryonic tissues. METHODS: Mid-through late gestation expression of 5-HT system-related enzymes, Tph1, Ddc, Maoa, and 5-HT transporters, Sert/Slc6a4, Oct3/Slc22a3, Vmat2/Slc18a2, and 5-HT in placenta and yolk sac were examined, with cell type-specific resolution, using multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization to co-localize transcripts and immunocytochemistry to co-localize the corresponding proteins and neurotransmitter. RESULTS: Tph1 and Ddc are found in the syncytiotrophoblast I (SynT-I) and sinusoidal trophoblast giant cells (S-TGC), whereas Maoa is expressed in SynT-I, syncytiotrophoblast II (SynT-II) and S-TGC. Oct3 expression is observed in the SynT-II only, while Vmat2 is mainly expressed in S-TGC. Surprisingly, there were comparatively high expression of Tph1, Ddc, and Maoa in the yolk sac visceral endoderm. DISCUSSION: In addition to trophoblast cells, visceral endoderm cells in the yolk sac may contribute to fetal 5-HT production.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a proteomics comparison of miRNA effects on extracellular matrix secretion by cardiac fibroblasts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mouse cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with pre-/anti-miR of miR-29b and miR-30c, and their conditioned medium was analyzed by mass spectrometry. miR-29b targeted a cadre of proteins involved in fibrosis, including multiple collagens, matrix metalloproteinases, and leukemia inhibitory factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, and pentraxin 3, 3 predicted targets of miR-29b. miR-29b also attenuated the cardiac fibroblast response to transforming growth factor-beta. In contrast, miR-30c had little effect on extracellular matrix production but opposite effects regarding leukemia inhibitory factor and insulin-like growth factor 1. Both miRNAs indirectly affected cardiac myocytes. On transfection with pre-miR-29b, the conditioned medium of cardiac fibroblasts lost its ability to support adhesion of rat ventricular myocytes and led to a significant reduction of cardiac myocyte proteins (alpha-actinin, cardiac myosin-binding protein C, and cardiac troponin I). Similarly, cardiomyocytes derived from mouse embryonic stem cells atrophied under pre-miR-29 conditioned medium, whereas pre-miR-30c conditioned medium had a prohypertrophic effect. Levels of miR-29a, miR-29c, and miR-30c, but not miR-29b, were significantly reduced in a mouse model of pathological but not physiological hypertrophy. Treatment with antagomiRs to miR-29b induced excess fibrosis after aortic constriction without overt deterioration in cardiac function.

Although the role of GDFs in the development of cartilaginous limb joints has been studied, limb joints are developmentally quite distinct from cranial sutures and how Gdf6 controls suture formation has remained unclear. In this study we show that coronal suture fusion in the Gdf6-/- mouse is due to accelerated differentiation of suture mesenchyme, prior to the onset of calvarial ossification. Gdf6 is expressed in the mouse frontal bone primordia from embryonic day (E) 10.5 through 12.5. In the Gdf6-/- embryo, the coronal suture fuses prematurely and concurrently with the initiation of osteogenesis in the cranial bones. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and Runx2 expression assays both showed that the suture width is reduced in Gdf6+/- embryos and is completely absent in Gdf6-/- embryos by E12.5. ALP activity is also increased in the suture mesenchyme of Gdf6+/- embryos compared to wild-type. This suggests Gdf6 delays differentiation of the mesenchyme occupying the suture, prior to the onset of ossification.

Recent studies have shown that perturbation of its development is associated with the pathogenesis of atrioventricular (AV) septal defect. Although the importance of the DMP to AV septation is now established, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its development are far from fully understood. Prior studies have demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is essential for proper formation of the AV endocardial cushions and the cardiac outflow tract. A role for BMP signaling in regulation of DMP development remained to be elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of BMP signaling in DMP development. METHODS AND RESULTS: Conditional deletion of the BMP receptor Alk3 from venous pole SHF cells leads to impaired formation of the DMP and a completely penetrant phenotype of ostium primum defect, a hallmark feature of AV septal defects. Analysis of mutants revealed decreased proliferative index of SHF cells and, consequently, reduced number of SHF cells at the cardiac venous pole. In contrast, volume and expression of markers associated with proliferation and active BMP/transforming growth factor beta signaling were not significantly altered in the AV cushions of SHF-Alk3 mutants. CONCLUSIONS: BMP signaling is required for expansion of the SHF-derived DMP progenitor population at the cardiac venous pole.

Here we elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the EA/TEF that occurs in mice lacking the BMP antagonist Noggin, which display correct dorsal/ventral patterning. To clarify the mechanism of this malformation, we use spatiotemporal manipulation of Noggin and BMP receptor 1A conditional alleles during foregut development. Surprisingly, we find that the expression of Noggin in the compartmentalizing endoderm is not required to generate distinct tracheal and esophageal tubes. Instead, we show that Noggin and BMP signaling attenuation are required in the early notochord to correctly resolve notochord cells from the dorsal foregut endoderm, which in turn, appears to be a prerequisite for foregut compartmentalization. Collectively, our findings support an emerging model for a mechanism underlying EA/TEF in which impaired notochord resolution from the early endoderm causes the foregut to be hypo-cellular just prior to the critical period of compartmentalization.

Previous studies have shown that the gamma3 chain is partnered with either the beta1 chain (in placenta) or beta2 chain (in the CNS) (Libby et al., 2000).

This study investigates the expression pattern of the gamma3 chain in mouse. We developed three new gamma3-reactive antibodies, and we show that the gamma3 chain is present in BMs. The distribution pattern is considerably more restricted than that of the gamma1 chain and within any tissue there is differential deposition into BM compartments. This is particularly true in the retina and brain, where gamma3 is uniquely expressed in a subset of the vascular basement membranes and the pial surface. We used conventional genetic ablation techniques to remove the gamma3 chain in mice; unlike other laminin null mice (alpha5, beta2, gamma1 nulls), these mice live a normal lifespan and have only minor abnormalities, the most striking of which are ectopic granule cells in the cerebellum and an apparent increase in capillary branching in the outer retina.

Several components of the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, including the transmembrane protein Vangl2, regulate caudal migration of FBM neurons in zebrafish, but their roles in neuronal migration in mouse have not been investigated in detail. Therefore, we analyzed FBM neuron migration in mouse looptail (Lp) mutants, in which Vangl2 is inactivated. In Vangl2(Lp/+) and Vangl2(Lp/Lp) embryos, FBM neurons failed to migrate caudally from rhombomere (r) 4 into r6. Although caudal migration was largely blocked, many FBM neurons underwent normal radial migration to the pial surface of the neural tube. In addition, hindbrain patterning and FBM progenitor specification were intact, and FBM neurons did not transfate into other non-migratory neuron types, indicating a specific effect on caudal migration. Since loss-of-function in some zebrafish Wnt/PCP genes does not affect caudal migration of FBM neurons, we tested whether this was also the case in mouse. Embryos null for Ptk7, a regulator of PCP signaling, had severe defects in caudal migration of FBM neurons. However, FBM neurons migrated normally in Dishevelled (Dvl) 1/2 double mutants, and in zebrafish embryos with disrupted Dvl signaling, suggesting that Dvl function is essentially dispensable for FBM neuron caudal migration. Consistent with this, loss of Dvl2 function in Vangl2(Lp/+) embryos did not exacerbate the Vangl2(Lp/+) neuronal migration phenotype.

This study compares the sub-cellular distribution of AQP0 and AQP5 during embryonic and postnatal fibre cell development in the mouse lens to understand how the immunolabelling patterns for both AQPs observed in adult lens are first established. Immunohistochemistry was used to map the cellular and sub-cellular distribution of AQP5 and AQP0 throughout the lens in cryosections from adult (6 weeks-8 months) and postnatal (0-2 weeks) mouse lenses and in sections from paraffin embedded mouse embryos (E10-E19). All sections were imaged by fluorescence confocal microscopy. Using antibodies directed against the C-terminus of each AQP, AQP5 was abundantly expressed early in development, being found in the cytoplasm of cells of the lens vesicle and surrounding tissues (E10), while AQP0 was detected later (E11), and only in the membranes of elongating primary fibre cells. During the course of subsequent embryonic and postnatal development the pattern of cytoplasmic AQP5 and membranous AQP0 labelling was maintained until postnatal day 6 (P6). From P6 AQP5 labelling became progressively more membranous initially in the lens nucleus and then later in all regions of the lens, while AQP0 labelling was abruptly lost in the lens nucleus due to C-terminal truncation. Our results show that the spatial distribution patterns of AQP0 and AQP5 observed in the adult lens are established during a narrow window of postnatal development (P6-P15) that precedes eye opening and coincides with regression of the hyaloid vascular system.

Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models have been constructed to assess the causal role of these putative oncogenic events and provide molecular insight into disease pathogenesis. While GEM models generally initiate neoplasia by manipulating a single gene, expression profiles of GEM tumors typically comprise hundreds of transcript alterations. It is unclear whether these transcriptional changes represent the pleiotropic effects of single oncogenes, and/or cooperating genomic or epigenomic events. Therefore, it was determined whether structural chromosomal alterations occur in GEM models of prostate cancer and whether the changes are concordant with human carcinomas. Whole genome array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used to identify somatic chromosomal copy number aberrations (SCNA) in the widely used TRAMP, Hi-Myc, Pten-null, and LADY GEM models. Interestingly, very few SCNAs were identified and the genomic architecture of Hi-Myc, Pten-null, and LADY tumors were essentially identical to the germline. TRAMP neuroendocrine carcinomas contained SCNAs, which comprised three recurrent aberrations including a single copy loss of chromosome 19 (encoding Pten). In contrast, cell lines derived from the TRAMP, Hi-Myc, and Pten-null tumors were notable for numerous SCNAs that included copy gains of chromosome 15 (encoding Myc) and losses of chromosome 11 (encoding p53).

However, the neuro-chemical identity of the leptin-STAT3 resistant arcuate neurons has not been determined and the underlying mechanisms responsible for development of cellular leptin resistance remain unclear. To investigate this, we first measured arcuate gene expression of known key signaling components of the LepRb signaling pathway and tested whether specifically the critical arcuate pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are resistant to LepRb-STAT3 signaling in mice given a high-fat-diet (HFD) compared to mice provided a low-fat control diet (LFD). We found that leptin-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation was decreased within POMC neurons of HFD mice. In addition, Leprb mRNA and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3) mRNA were elevated in the arcuate of HFD mice. To investigate whether increased LepRb expression per se in POMC neurons can influence development of DIO and Socs3 expression, we created mice that over-express LepRb selectively in POMC neurons (POMC-LepRb). No differences in body weight, fat mass or food intake were found between LFD POMC-LepRb mice and LFD controls. Surprisingly, body weight, fat mass and caloric intake of HFD POMC-LepRb mice was markedly higher than HFD control mice.

In this report, we examined in detail the synergistic activation of insulin transcription by Glis3 with coregulators, CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1), neuronal differentiation 1 (NeuroD1), and v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A (MafA).

Mutations in the GlisBS or small interfering RNA-directed knockdown of GLIS3 diminished insulin promoter activation by Pdx1, NeuroD1, and MafA, and neither Pdx1 nor MafA was able to stably associate with the insulin promoter when the GlisBS were mutated. In addition, a GlisBS mutation in the INS promoter implicated in the development of neonatal diabetes similarly abated activation by Pdx1, NeuroD1, and MafA that could be reversed by increased expression of exogenous Glis3. We therefore propose that recruitment of CBP/p300 by Glis3 provides a scaffold for the formation of a larger transcriptional regulatory complex that stabilizes the binding of Pdx1, NeuroD1, and MafA complexes to their respective binding sites within the insulin promoter.

The autophagic machinery supplies energy by recycling intracellular components and facilitates the removal of apoptotic cells. In the inner ear, autophagy has been reported to play roles during early development in the chicken embryo and in the response to otic injury in the adult mouse. However, there are no studies on the expression of the autophagy machinery in the postnatal and adult inner ear. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is one of the factors that regulate both otic development and cochlear postnatal maturation and function. Here, we hypothesised that autophagy could be one of the processes involved in the cochlear development and functional maturation. We report that autophagy-related genes (ATG) Becn1, Atg4g and Atg5 are expressed in the mouse cochlea, vestibular system and brainstem cochlear nuclei from late developmental stages to adulthood. Atg9 was studied in the mouse cochlea and showed a similar pattern. The presence of autophagic flux was confirmed by decreased sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) and increased relative levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II). Inner ear autophagy flux is developmentally regulated and is lower at perinatal stages than in the adult mouse, where an expression plateau is reached at the age of two-months, coinciding with the age at which full functional activity is reached. Expression is maintained in adult mice and declines after the age of twelve months. LC3B labelling showed that autophagy was primarily associated with spiral ganglion neurons. Over time, Igf1 wild type mice showed lower expression of genes coding for IGF-1 high affinity receptor and the family factor IGF-2 than null mice.

Here we show Wdpcp can regulate PCP by direct modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. These studies were made possible by recovery of a Wdpcp mutant mouse model. Wdpcp-deficient mice exhibit phenotypes reminiscent of Bardet-Biedl/Meckel-Gruber ciliopathy syndromes, including cardiac outflow tract and cochlea defects associated with PCP perturbation. We observed Wdpcp is localized to the transition zone, and in Wdpcp-deficient cells, Sept2, Nphp1, and Mks1 were lost from the transition zone, indicating Wdpcp is required for recruitment of proteins essential for ciliogenesis. Wdpcp is also found in the cytoplasm, where it is localized in the actin cytoskeleton and in focal adhesions. Wdpcp interacts with Sept2 and is colocalized with Sept2 in actin filaments, but in Wdpcp-deficient cells, Sept2 was lost from the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting Wdpcp is required for Sept2 recruitment to actin filaments.

Twisted gastrulation (TWSG1) is a secreted BMP binding protein that modulates BMP ligand availability in the extracellular space.

In the mature duct, Twsg1 expression is primarily restricted to the myoepithelial layer. Global deletion of Twsg1 leads to a delay in ductal elongation, reduced secondary branching, enlarged terminal end buds, and occluded lumens. This is associated with an increase in luminal epithelial cell number and a decrease in apoptosis. In the MG, pSMAD1/5/8 level and the expression of BMP target genes are reduced, consistent with a decrease in BMP signaling.

Here we addressed this question by investigating OR gene expression via in situ hybridization when sensory experience or neuronal excitability is manipulated. We first examined the expression patterns of fifteen OR genes in mice which underwent neonatal, unilateral naris closure.

Using TLR2 deficient (KO), TLR2/TLR4 double deficient (dKO), and wild-type (WT) mice, we demonstrate that TLR2 KO mice are highly responsive to polymicrobial infection-induced periapical lesion caused by over activation of TLR4 signal transduction pathway that resulted in elevation of NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa B) and proinflammatory cytokine production.

Using a quantitative complementation test, we confirmed that Pappa2 is responsible for the effects of the previously-identified QTL, demonstrating that natural variation in the Pappa2 gene contributes to variation in postnatal growth in mice.

In mice, conditional beta-catenin inactivation in premigratory neural crest cells abolishes both sensory neuron and melanocyte formation. Intriguingly, the generation of melanocytes is also prevented by activation of beta-catenin in the premigratory neural crest, which promotes sensory neurogenesis at the expense of other neural crest derivatives. This raises the question of how Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates the formation of distinct lineages from the neural crest. Using various Cre lines to conditionally activate beta-catenin in neural crest cells at different developmental stages, we show that neural crest cell fate decisions in vivo are subject to temporal control by Wnt/beta-catenin. Unlike in premigratory neural crest, beta-catenin activation in migratory neural crest cells promotes the formation of ectopic melanoblasts, while the production of most other lineages is suppressed. Ectopic melanoblasts emerge at sites of neural crest target structures and in many tissues usually devoid of neural crest-derived cells. beta-catenin activation at later stages in glial progenitors or in melanoblasts does not lead to surplus melanoblasts, indicating a narrow time window of Wnt/beta-catenin responsiveness during neural crest cell migration.

Hypoxia causes the activation of eEF2K and induces eEF2 phosphorylation independently of previously known inputs into eEF2K. Here, we show that eEF2K is subject to hydroxylation on proline-98.

Its hydroxylation partially impairs the binding of calmodulin to eEF2K and markedly limits the calmodulin-stimulated activity of eEF2K. Neuronal cells depend on oxygen, and eEF2K helps to protect them from hypoxia. eEF2K is the first example of a protein directly involved in a major energy-consuming process to be regulated by proline hydroxylation.

To better understand the sequence of events occurring in familial and sporadic Parkinson disease, we generated bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice (SNCA-OVX) that express wild-type alpha-synuclein from the complete human SNCA locus at disease-relevant levels and display a transgene expression profile that recapitulates that of endogenous alpha-synuclein.

Maternal diabetes in vivo and high glucose in vitro significantly down-regulated miR-322 and up-regulated TRAF3 protein expression. Overexpression of the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), or treatment with the SOD1 mimetic Tempol, abolished the effect of maternal diabetes or high glucose on miR-322 and TRAF3 expression, respectively. A miRNA target prediction algorithm reveals 2 miR-322 binding sites the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of TRAF3 mRNA. A RNA pull-down assay using biotin-labeled miR-322 revealed that miR-322 interacted with the 3'-UTR of TRAF3 mRNA at one specific binding site. The miR-322 mimic or TRAF3 knockdown blocked high glucose-increased TRAF3 protein expression and apoptosis, whereas the miR-322 inhibitor mimicked the effect of high glucose leading to TRAF3 up-regulation and apoptosis.

METHODS: The expression of Hedgehog pathway components in the cornea was assayed by immunohistochemistry, western blot and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in wild-type mice and mice that were heterozygous null for the gene encoding the transcription factor, paired box gene 6 (Pax6). Corneal epithelial wound healing and cell migration assays were performed after pharmacological upregulation and downregulation of the hedgehog pathway. Reporter mice, mosaic for expression of the gene encoding beta-galactosidase (LacZ), were crossed to Pax6(+/-) mice, mice heterozygous for the gene encoding GLI-Kruppel family member GLI3, and Pax6(+/-)Gli3(+/-) double heterozygotes, to assay patterns of cell migration and corneal epithelial organization in vivo. RESULTS: Corneal epithelial wound healing rates increased in response to application of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), but only in mice with wild-type Pax6 dosage. Downregulation of Hedgehog signalling inhibited corneal epithelial cell proliferation. Pax6(+/-) corneal epithelia showed increased proliferation in response to exogenous Shh, but not increased migration. Desert hedgehog (Dhh) was shown to be the major endogenous ligand, with Shh detectable only by RT-PCR and only after epithelial wounding. The activity of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-gamma (PI3Kgamma) was not required for the increased migration response in response to Shh. Nuclear expression of the activator form of the transcription factor Gli3 (which mediates Hh signalling) was reduced in Pax6(+/-) corneal epithelia. Pax6(+/-)Gli3(+/-) double heterozygotes showed highly disrupted patterns of clonal arrangement of cells in the corneal epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: The data show key roles for endogenous Dhh signalling in maintenance and regeneration of the corneal epithelium, demonstrate an interaction between Pax6 and Hh signalling in the corneal epithelium, and show that failure of Hh signalling pathways is a feature of Pax6(+/-) corneal disease that cannot be remedied pharmacologically by addition of the ligands.", "publish_time": "2012-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 4, "other diagram": 10, "fluorescence": 13, "3D structure": 1, "macromolecule sequence": 13}}, "5638844": {"cord_uid": "5638844", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Deletion of yes-associated protein (YAP) specifically in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells reveals a crucial role for YAP in mouse cardiovascular development.", "abstract": "RATIONALE: Our previous study has shown that yes-associated protein (YAP) plays a crucial role in the phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in response to arterial injury.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the functional role of YAP in cardiovascular development in mice and determine the mechanisms underlying YAP's actions. METHODS AND RESULTS: YAP was deleted in cardiomyocytes and vascular SMCs by crossing YAP flox mice with SM22alpha-Cre transgenic mice. Cardiac/SMC-specific deletion of YAP directed by SM22alpha-Cre resulted in perinatal lethality in mice because of profound cardiac defects including hypoplastic myocardium, membranous ventricular septal defect, and double outlet right ventricle. The cardiac/SMC-specific YAP knockout mice also displayed severe vascular abnormalities including hypoplastic arterial wall, short/absent brachiocephalic artery, and retroesophageal right subclavian artery. Deletion of YAP in mouse vascular SMCs induced expression of a subset of cell cycle arrest genes including G-protein-coupled receptor 132 (Gpr132). Silencing Gpr132 promoted SMC proliferation, whereas overexpression of Gpr132 attenuated SMC growth by arresting cell cycle in G0/G1 phase, suggesting that ablation of YAP-induced impairment of SMC proliferation was mediated, at least in part, by induction of Gpr132 expression. Mechanistically, YAP recruited the epigenetic repressor histone deacetylase-4 to suppress Gpr132 gene expression via a muscle CAT element in the Gpr132 gene.

Unlike most neural precursors, gc precursors divide symmetrically, accounting for their massive expansion. We found that oriented cell divisions underlie an overall anteroposteriorly polarized growth of the cerebellum and gc clone geometry.

In this study, we designed and functionally characterized an artificial DNA-binding domain that neutralizes the function of a cis-regulatory DNA element associated with adult beta-globin gene expression.

After a 6-day exposure, similar analyses were performed in WT and miR-150 KO neonates during recovery at 7, 14, and 21 days. miR-150 KO neonates displayed an increased capillary network, decreased inflammation, and less alveolar damage compared with WT neonates after hyperoxia exposure. The early induction of GPNMB and sGPNMB were found in miR-150 KO neonates. The recombinant GPNMB, which contained a soluble portion of GPNMB, promoted endothelial tube formation in vitro and enhanced angiogenesis in vivo. The increased capillaries in the hyperoxic lungs of miR-150 KO neonates appeared dysmorphic. They were abnormally enlarged in size and occasionally laid at subepithelial regions in the alveoli.

Wilms' tumor-1 (Wt1) is associated with the activation and reactivation of the epicardium and therefore potentially important for the differentiation and regenerative capacity of the epicardium. To gain more insight into the regulation of Wt1 we examined the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Wt1 during murine development and after cardiac injury. Interestingly, we found that Wt1 is expressed in the majority of the cardiac endothelial cells within the myocardial ventricular layer of the developing heart from E12.5 onwards. In the adult heart only a subset of coronary endothelial cells remains positive for Wt1. After myocardial infarction Wt1 is temporally upregulated in the endothelial cells of the infarcted area and the border zone of the heart. In vitro experiments show that endothelial Wt1 expression can be induced by hypoxia. We show that Wt1 is associated with endothelial cell proliferation: Wt1 expression is higher in proliferating endothelial cells, Wt1 knockdown inhibits the proliferation of endothelial cells, and Wt1 regulates CyclinD1 expression.

Lumican deficiency resulted in significant (50%) perinatal death and further examination of the lum(-/-) neonatal hearts revealed an increase in myocardial tissue without a significant increase in cell proliferation. However cardiomyocytes from surviving postnatal day 0 (P0), 1 month (1 mo) and adult (4 mo) lum(-/-) hearts were significantly larger than their wild type (WT) littermates. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the increased cardiomyocyte size in the lum(-/-) hearts correlated with alteration of the cardiomyocyte pericellular ECM components collagenalpha1(I) and the class I SLRP decorin (DCN). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the ratio of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) decorated DCN to core DCN was reduced in P0 and 1 mo lum(-/-) hearts. There was also a reduction in the beta and gamma forms of collagenalpha1(I) in lum(-/-) hearts. While the total insoluble collagen content was significantly reduced, the fibril size was increased in lum(-/-) hearts, indicating that LUM may play a role in collagen fiber stability and lateral fibril assembly. These results suggest that LUM controls cardiomyocyte growth by regulating the pericellular ECM and also indicates that LUM may coordinate multiple factors of collagen assembly in the murine heart. Further investigation into the role of LUM may yield novel therapeutic targets and/or biomarkers for patients with cardiovascular disease.", "publish_time": "2015-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"residual": 2, "line chart": 18, "fluorescence": 1, "other diagram": 8, "macromolecule sequence": 6, "gel/blot": 1}}, "6102143": {"cord_uid": "6102143", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Transgenic mouse model expressing P53(R172H), luciferase, EGFP, and KRAS(G12D) in a single open reading frame for live imaging of tumor.", "abstract": "Genetically engineered mouse cancer models allow tumors to be imaged in vivo via co-expression of a reporter gene with a tumor-initiating gene.

We demonstrate that this assay is capable of reliably detecting LH down to a theoretical limit of 0.117 ng/mL in a 2-muL fraction of whole blood. Using an established frequent blood collection procedure, we validated the accuracy of this method by determining the pulsatile LH secretion in early-adult (10 weeks old) C57BL6/J male mice. Data demonstrate regular pulsatile release of LH, with peaks in LH secretion rarely exceeding 3 ng/mL. Moreover, assessment of LH release in Gpr54 knockout mice demonstrates the lack of pulsatile LH release after the loss of kisspeptin-mediated pubertal maturation. We next determined age-associated changes in pulsatile LH secretion by assessment of LH secretion in prepubertal (28 days old) C57BL6/J male mice and repeated assessment in the same mice in adulthood (120 days old). Data demonstrate that the rise in total LH secretion in mice after pubertal maturation occurs along with an overall rise in the pulsatile LH secretion rate. This was coupled with a significant increase in the number of LH secretory events (number of pulses).

In vitro studies using NPC1L1-overexpressing intestinal cells and in vivo studies with Npc1l1-knockout mice revealed that intestinal VK absorption is NPC1L1-dependent and inhibited by ezetimibe, an NPC1L1-selective inhibitor clinically used for dyslipidemia.

Adverse events caused by the coadministration of ezetimibe and warfarin were rescued by oral VK supplementation, suggesting that the drug-drug interaction effects observed were the consequence of ezetimibe-mediated VK malabsorption.

BTK kinase domain inhibition reproduces this effect in mature anti-insulin B cells, with less impact at transitional stages. The increased dependence of anti-insulin B cells on BTK became particularly evident in an Igkappa locus site-directed model, in which 50% of B cells edit their BCRs to noninsulin specificities; Btk deficiency preferentially depletes insulin binders from the follicular and marginal zone B cell subsets.

We show that the contribution of STRA6 to retinol uptake by tissues in vivo is small and that, with the exception of the eye, ablation of Stra6 has only a modest effect on retinoid homeostasis and does not impair physiological functions that critically depend on retinoic acid in the embryo or in the adult. However, ablation of Stra6 effectively protects mice from RBP-induced suppression of insulin signaling. Thus one biological function of STRA6 in tissues other than the eye appears to be the coupling of circulating holo-RBP levels to cell signaling, in turn regulating key processes such as insulin response.", "publish_time": "2013-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"compound": 1, "line chart": 26, "fluorescence": 2, "other diagram": 2, "macromolecule sequence": 13, "3D structure": 5, "gel/blot": 1}}, "5604167": {"cord_uid": "5604167", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "'Reduced malignancy as a mechanism for longevity in mice with adenylyl cyclase type 5 disruption'.", "abstract": "Disruption of adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5) knockout (KO) is a novel model for longevity. Because malignancy is a major cause of death and reduced lifespan in mice, the goal of this investigation was to examine the role of AC5KO in protecting against cancer. There have been numerous discoveries in genetically engineered mice over the past several decades, but few have been translated to the bedside. One major reason is that it is difficult to alter a gene in patients, but rather a pharmacological approach is more appropriate. The current investigation employs a parallel construction to examine the extent to which inhibiting AC5, either in a genetic knockout (KO) or by a specific pharmacological inhibitor protects against cancer. This study is unique, not only because a combined genetic and pharmacological approach is rare, but also there are no prior studies on the extent to which AC5 affects cancer. We found that AC5KO delayed age-related tumor incidence significantly, as well as protecting against mammary tumor development in AC5KO x MMTV-HER-2 neu mice, and B16F10 melanoma tumor growth, which can explain why AC5KO is a model of longevity. In addition, a Food and Drug Administration approved antiviral agent, adenine 9-beta-D-arabinofuranoside (Vidarabine or AraAde), which specifically inhibits AC5, reduces LP07 lung and B16F10 melanoma tumor growth in syngeneic mice.

We found that patients with chronic rhinosinusitis have elevated glucose concentrations in their nasal secretions, and other reports have shown that patients with hyperglycemia likewise have elevated nasal glucose levels.

Suppression of the proteasome promotes autophagy for compensation and simultaneous inhibition of autophagy can selectively increase apoptosis in transformed cells, but not in untransformed or normal cells. Transformed cells are thus more dependent on autophagy for survival. However, it is unclear whether long-term autophagy inhibition/insufficiency would affect such dependency. To address this question, we transformed wild-type and autophagy-deficient cells lacking a key autophagy-related gene Atg5 with activated Ras. We found that such transformation did not make the autophagy-deficient tumor cells more susceptible to proteasome inhibitors than the wild type tumor cells, although the transformed cells were in general more sensitive to proteasome inhibition. We then compared the effect of acute versus constitutive knock-down of a key autophagy initiating molecule, Beclin 1, in an already transformed cancer cell line. In a wild-type U251 glioblastoma cell line (autophagy intact), increased sensitivity to proteasome inhibition was induced immediately after the knock-down of Beclin 1 expression with a specific siRNA (acute autophagy deficiency). On the other hand, when the tumor cell line was selected over a long period to achieve constitutive knock-down of Beclin 1, its sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors was no higher than that of the wild-type tumor cells.

Pou4f2 expression has been reported in a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the retina, in the midbrain, and in the germline. In this study, we characterize the expression pattern of this Cre-recombinase line and report its utility in targeted deletion, temporal deletion, RGC depletion, and germline targeting, which can be regulated by the sex of the Cre-carrying mouse. METHODS: Pou4f2(Cre) was mapped by using a combination of PCR and sequencing of PCR products to better understand the construct and to locate where it was inserted within the Pou4f2 locus. Cre expression patterns were examined by crossing Pou4f2(Cre/+) mice to Cre reporter mice. Immunohistochemistry was used to further define the pattern of Cre expression and Cre-mediated recombination within the retina, brain, and other tissues. RESULTS: An internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-Cre cassette was inserted into the Pou4f2 gene disrupting normal gene function, as verified by the depletion of RGCs in mice homozygous for the insert. Pou4f2(Cre) expression was observed in the retina, brain, peripheral neurons, and male germ cells. Germline recombination was observed when the sire carried the Cre and the target for recombination. In all other breeding schemes, recombination was observed within subsets of cells within the retina, brain, intestines, heart, and gonads. In the retina, Cre efficiently targets recombination in neurons within the RGC layer (RGL), the inner nuclear layer (INL), and a small percentage of photoreceptors, activity that has not been previously reported. Unlike most other Cre lines active in the inner retina, recombination in Muller and other glia was not observed in mice carrying Pou4f2(Cre) . Within the visual centers of the brain, Cre targets recombination in about 15% of cells within the superchiasmatic nucleus, lateral geniculate nucleus, and superior colliculus. CONCLUSIONS: Pou4f2(Cre) provides multiple uses for the vision researcher's genetic toolkit. First, Pou4f2(Cre) is a knock-in allele that can be used to eliminate Pou4f2, resulting in depletion of RGCs. Second, expression of Cre in male germ cells makes this strain an efficient germline activator of recombination, for example, to target LoxP-flanked sequences in the whole mouse. Third, Pou4f2(Cre) efficiently targets RGCs, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and a small number of photoreceptors within the retina, as well as the visual centers in the brain. Unlike other Cre recombinase lines that target retinal neurons, no recombination was observed in Muller or other retinal glia.

This mechanism depends on several core factors in the exon junction complex (EJC), eIF4A3, RBM8a, Magoh, and BTZ, as well as peripheral factors to distinguish premature stop codons (PTCs) from normal stop codons in transcripts. Recently, emerging evidence has indicated that NMD factors are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). However, the mechanism in which these factors control embryonic brain development is not clear. RESULT: We found that RBM8a is critical for proliferation and differentiation in cortical neural progenitor cells (NPCs). RBM8a is highly expressed in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the early embryonic cortex, suggesting that RBM8a may play a role in regulating NPCs. RBM8a overexpression stimulates embryonic NPC proliferation and suppresses neuronal differentiation. Conversely, knockdown of RBM8a in the neocortex reduces NPC proliferation and promotes premature neuronal differentiation. Moreover, overexpression of RBM8a suppresses cell cycle exit and keeps cortical NPCs in a proliferative state. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this phenotype, genome-wide RNAseq was used to identify potential downstream genes of RBM8a in the brain, which have been implicated in autism and neurodevelopmental disorders. Interestingly, autism and schizophrenia risk genes are highly represented in downstream transcripts of RBM8a. In addition, RBM8a regulates multiple alternative splicing genes and NMD targets that are implicated in ASD. Taken together, this data suggests a novel role of RBM8a in the regulation of neurodevelopment.

This mutation causes a splice defect in which the mutant mRNA escapes nonsense mediated decay by skipping both exons 3 and 4.

Transgenic expression of mutant betaA3/A1-crystallin but not the wild type protein results in toxicity and abnormalities in the maturation and orientation of differentiating lens fibers in c.97_357del CRYBA1 transgenic mice, leading to a small spherical lens, cataract, and often lens capsule rupture.

We hypothesised that the latter process contributes to cochlear hair cell cytosolic Ca(2+) homeostasis.

TRPC3(-/-) mice showed significantly stronger DPOAE (2f1 - f2 ) growth functions than wild-type (WT) littermates within the frequency range of best hearing acuity.

Using mouse PDA models as well as human samples, we show clear evidence that MUC1 regulates the expression and secretion of PDGFA.

Furthermore, we show that CXCR3(+) innate CD8(+) T cells express higher transcript levels of antiapoptotic but lower levels of proapoptotic factors, respond more robustly to IL-2 and IL-15, and produce significantly more IFN-gamma and granzyme B. Interestingly, CXCR3(+) innate CD8(+) T cells do not respond to IL-12 or IL-18 alone, but produce significant amounts of IFN-gamma on stimulation with a combination of these cytokines. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that CXCR3(+) and CXCR3(-) innate CD8(+) T cells are phenotypically and functionally distinct.

In contrast, mutation of Thr(3)(7)(2) to Ala gave a protein that bound LDs and functioned the same as the wild-type protein. In nonstimulated adipocytes, the Asp mutation led to decreased LD association and basal lipolytic activity of ATGL, whereas the Ala mutation produced opposite effects. Moreover, the LD translocation of ATGL upon beta-adrenergic stimulation was also compromised by the Asp mutation. In accord with these findings, the Ala mutation promoted and the Asp mutation attenuated the capacity of ATGL to mediate lipolysis in adipocytes under both basal and stimulated conditions.

Although compelling evidence indicates that the majority of triacylglycerol in very low-density lipoprotein is derived from re-esterification of lipolytic products released by endoplasmic reticulum-associated lipases, little is known about roles of acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs) in this process. We aimed to investigate the contribution of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in lipid metabolism and lipoprotein secretion in primary mouse and human hepatocytes. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We used highly selective small-molecule inhibitors of DGAT1 and DGAT2, and we tracked storage and secretion of lipids synthesized de novo from [(3)H]acetic acid and from exogenously supplied [(3)H]oleic acid. Inactivation of individual DGAT activity did not affect incorporation of either radiolabeled precursor into intracellular triacylglycerol, whereas combined inactivation of both DGATs severely attenuated triacylglycerol synthesis. However, inhibition of DGAT2 augmented fatty acid oxidation, whereas inhibition of DGAT1 increased triacylglycerol secretion, suggesting preferential channeling of separate DGAT-derived triacylglycerol pools to distinct metabolic pathways. Inactivation of DGAT2 impaired cytosolic lipid droplet expansion, whereas DGAT1 inactivation promoted large lipid droplet formation. Moreover, inactivation of DGAT2 attenuated expression of lipogenic genes. Finally, triacylglycerol secretion was significantly reduced on DGAT2 inhibition without altering extracellular apolipoprotein B levels.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Mouse bone marrow-derived M1 macrophages acted as lymphoid tissue inducer cells. Indeed, they expressed high levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and membrane-bound lymphotoxin (LT)-alpha, two inducing cytokines that triggered expression of the chemokines CCL19, CCL20, and CXCL16, as did M1 supernatant. The blockade of LTbetaR signalling with LTbetaR-Ig had no effect, whereas that of TNFR1/2 signalling reduced chemokine expression by VSMCs in both wild-type (WT) and LTbetaR KO mice, demonstrating that LTbetaR signalling is dispensable for the M1-inducing effect. This effect was corroborated by the development of TLOs observed in LTbetaR KO->apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE KO) aortic segments after orthotopic transplantation. Furthermore, treatment of ApoE KO mice with anti-TNF-alpha antibody decreased the number and incidence of aortic TLOs. Finally, lymphoid nodules composed of T and B cells formed in in vivo-implanted scaffolds seeded with VSMCs previously stimulated ex vivo by M1-conditioned medium. CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first to identify M1 macrophages as inducer cells that trigger the expression of chemokines by VSMCs independently of LTbetaR signalling.

APPROACH AND RESULTS: Both FABP4/5 were abundantly expressed in capillary endothelium in the heart and skeletal muscle. The uptake of a FA analogue, 125I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methyl pentadecanoic acid, was significantly reduced in these tissues in double-knockout (DKO) mice for FABP4/5 compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, the uptake of a glucose analogue, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, was remarkably increased in DKO mice. The expression of transcripts for the oxidative catabolism of FAs was reduced during fasting, whereas transcripts for the glycolytic pathway were not altered in DKO hearts. Notably, metabolome analysis revealed that phosphocreatine and ADP levels were significantly lower in DKO hearts, whereas ATP content was kept at a normal level. The protein expression levels of the glucose transporter Glut4 and the phosphorylated form of phosphofructokinase-2 were increased in DKO hearts, whereas the phosphorylation of insulin receptor-beta and Akt was comparable between wild-type and DKO hearts during fasting, suggesting that a dramatic increase in glucose usage during fasting is insulin independent and is at least partly attributed to the post-transcriptional and allosteric regulation of key proteins that regulate glucose uptake and glycolysis.

S1P is a bioactive phospholipid produced in response to multiple stimuli, which regulates many cellular processes. S1P is secreted to the extracellular milieu where it exerts its function by binding a family of G-protein coupled receptors (S1PRs), causing their activation in an autocrine or paracrine manner. The process, termed cell-autonomous S1PR signaling, plays a role in survival and migration. Indeed, PDGF uses cell-autonomous S1PR signaling to promote cell migration; we show here that this S1P pathway requires Memo. Using vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) with Memo knock-down we show that their survival in conditions of serum-starvation is impaired. Furthermore, Memo loss in HUVECs causes a reduction of junctional VE-cadherin and an increase in sprout formation. Each of these phenotypes is rescued by S1P or S1P agonist addition, showing that Memo also plays an important role in cell-autonomous S1PR signaling in endothelial cells.

During mouse embryonic development, the preBotC begins to generate eupnoeic rhythmicity at embryonic day (E) 15.5, but the network's ability to also generate sigh-like activity remains unexplored at prenatal stages. Using transverse brainstem slice preparations we monitored the neuronal population activity of the preBotC at different embryonic ages.

Wnt signaling pathways regulate the development and differentiation of stem cells in various organs. Although a beta-catenin-independent noncanonical Wnt pathway is essential for cell adhesion and polarity, the physiological functions of noncanonical Wnt pathways in liver development are unknown. Here we describe a functional role for Wnt5a, a noncanonical Wnt ligand, in the differentiation of mouse hepatoblasts. Wnt5a was expressed in mesenchymal cells and other cells of wild-type (WT) midgestational fetal liver. We analyzed fetal liver phenotypes in Wnt5a-deficient mice using a combination of histological and molecular techniques. Expression levels of Sox9 and the number of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1beta(+) HNF4alpha(-) biliary precursor cells were significantly higher in Wnt5a-deficient liver relative to WT liver. In Wnt5a-deficient fetal liver, in vivo formation of primitive bile ductal structures was significantly enhanced relative to WT littermates. We also investigated the function of Wnt5a protein and downstream signaling molecules using a three-dimensional culture system that included primary hepatoblasts or a hepatic progenitor cell line. In vitro differentiation assays showed that Wnt5a retarded the formation of bile duct-like structures in hepatoblasts, leading instead to hepatic maturation of such cells. Whereas Wnt5a signaling increased steady-state levels of phosphorylated calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in fetal liver, inhibition of CaMKII activity resulted in the formation of significantly more and larger-sized bile duct-like structures in vitro compared with those in vehicle-supplemented controls.

Hepatic PTP1B deficiency, using the Alb-Cre promoter to drive Ptp1b deletion from birth in mice, improves glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of decreasing liver PTP1B levels in obese and insulin-resistant adult mice. METHODS: Inducible Ptp1b liver-specific knockout mice were generated using SA-Cre-ER(T2) mice crossed with Ptp1b floxed (Ptp1b(fl/fl)) mice. Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to induce obesity and insulin resistance. Tamoxifen was administered in the HFD to induce liver-specific deletion of Ptp1b (SA-Ptp1b(-/-) mice). Body weight, glucose homeostasis, lipid homeostasis, serum adipokines, insulin signalling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were examined. RESULTS: Despite no significant change in body weight relative to HFD-fed Ptp1b(fl/fl) control mice, HFD-fed SA-Ptp1b(-/-) mice exhibited a reversal of glucose intolerance as determined by improved glucose and pyruvate tolerance tests, decreased fed and fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, lower HOMA of insulin resistance, circulating leptin, serum and liver triacylglycerols, serum NEFA and decreased HFD-induced ER stress.

CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Inducible liver-specific PTP1B knockdown reverses glucose intolerance and improves lipid homeostasis in HFD-fed obese and insulin-resistant adult mice.

In this study, we determined that a polyclonal antibody (pAb) (R&D Systems) against extracellular domains of mouse PD-L2 (mPD-L2) could recognize antigen(s) in diverse mouse tissues, including the anterior and intermediate pituitary gland, olfactory bulbs and olfactory epithelium, tongue epithelium, keratinized epithelial cells and skin and whisker hair follicles. These findings differed from previous reports of mPD-L2 localization. Reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analyses, however, were unable to detect any mPD-L2 transcripts or proteins of the 25-kD predicted molecular weight in RNA and protein extracts, respectively, from the above tissues, suggesting that the anti-mPD-L2 pAb cross-reacts with certain novel antigen(s). Developmental studies revealed that the earliest expression of mPD-L2-like antigen was in the olfactory epithelium at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5). At E14.5, mPD-L2-like antigen was present in the skin, tongue and follicles of the skin and whiskers. The distribution patterns of mPD-L2-like antigen remained similar from E18.5 to adulthood. The results of bioinformatic analysis and other experiments suggested neural cell adhesion molecule and hemicentin-1 as candidate proteins with cross-reactivity to the anti-mPD-L2 pAb. These results demonstrate that care is required in interpreting staining patterns generated when anti-PD-L2 pAb is used to locate PD-L2-expressing cells in the central nervous system and epithelial tissues, such as the olfactory epithelium.

How the development of the olfactory epithelium and neurogenesis within are affected by the loss of N-myc has, however, not been determined. To address these issues, we examined an N-myc(Foxg1Cre) conditional mouse line, in which N-myc is depleted in the olfactory epithelium. First changes in N-myc mutants were detected at E11.5, with reduced proliferation and neurogenesis in a slightly smaller olfactory epithelium. The phenotype was more pronounced at E13.5, with a complete lack of Hes5-positive progenitor cells, decreased proliferation, and neurogenesis. In addition, stereological analyses revealed reduced cell size of post-mitotic neurons in the olfactory epithelium, which contributed to a smaller olfactory pit. Furthermore, we observed diminished proliferation and neurogenesis also in the vomeronasal organ, which likewise was reduced in size. In addition, the generation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons was severely reduced in N-myc mutants. Thus, diminished neurogenesis and proliferation in combination with smaller neurons might explain the morphological defects in the N-myc depleted olfactory structures. Moreover, our results suggest an important role for N-myc in regulating ongoing neurogenesis, in part by maintaining the Hes5-positive progenitor pool.

RESULTS: To investigate the spatiotemporal patterning of NCCs in vivo, we have generated Sox10ER(T2) CreER(T2) (SECE) mice, a transgenic line driving inducible Cre expression in NCCs. Inducing Cre activity at different stages triggered reporter expression in distinct NCC populations in SECE; R26R mice. By optimizing the timing and dosage of tamoxifen administration, we controlled Cre expression specifically in cranial NCCs. Using this approach, we demonstrate an important role for PDGFRalpha in cranial NCCs mitosis within the mandibular processes. Further reducing Cre activity within the cranial NCCs of SECE; R26R embryos revealed that SECE labels preferentially progenitors of medial nasal process (MNP) rather than the lateral nasal process (LNP), before their formation from the frontonasal prominence (FNP).

Elucidating how CaMKII suppresses ATF6 is therefore essential to understanding this insulin resistance pathway. We show that CaMKII phosphorylates and blocks nuclear translocation of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). As a result, HDAC4-mediated SUMOylation of the corepressor DACH1 is decreased, which protects DACH1 from proteasomal degradation. DACH1, together with nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR), represses Atf6 transcription, leading to activation of the PERK-TRB3 pathway and defective insulin signaling.

We used C57BL/6 PDE3B knockout (KO) mice to elucidate mechanisms involved in the formation of BAT in epididymal WAT (EWAT) depots.

Many of the genes regulated by E2 via estrogen receptors are repressed, yet the molecular mechanisms that mediate E2-induced gene repression are currently unknown. We hypothesized that E2, acting through estrogen receptors, regulates expression of microRNAs (miRs) leading to repression of expression of specific target genes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report that E2 significantly upregulates the expression of 26 miRs and downregulates the expression of 6 miRs in mouse aorta. E2-mediated upregulation of one of these miRs, miR-203, was chosen for further study. In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), E2-mediated upregulation of miR-203 is mediated by estrogen receptor-alpha (but not estrogen receptor-beta) via transcriptional upregulation of the primary miR. We demonstrate that the transcription factors Zeb-1 and AP-1 play critical roles in mediating E2-induced upregulation of miR-203 transcription. We show further that miR-203 mediates E2-induced repression of Abl1, and p63 protein abundance in VSMC. Finally, knocking-down miR-203 abolishes E2-mediated inhibition of VSMC proliferation, and overexpression of miR-203 inhibits cultured VSMC proliferation, but not vascular endothelial cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that E2 regulates expression of miRs in the vasculature and support the estrogen receptors-dependent induction of miRs as a mechanism for E2-mediated gene repression.

In the current study, we investigate the role of Semaphorin3A (Sema3A), a cell guidance chemorepellent, on angioblast migration and corneal avascularity during development. We show that Sema3A, Vegf, and Nrp1 are expressed in the anterior eye during cornea development. Sema3A mRNA transcripts are expressed at significantly higher levels than Vegf in the lens that is positioned adjacent to the presumptive cornea. Blockade of Sema3A signaling via lens removal or injection of a synthetic Sema3A inhibitor causes ectopic migration of angioblasts into the cornea and results in its subsequent vascularization. In addition, using bead implantation, we demonstrate that exogenous Sema3A protein inhibits Vegf-induced vascularization of the cornea. In agreement with these findings, loss of Sema/Nrp1 signaling in Nrp1(Sema-) mutant mice results in ectopic angioblasts and vascularization of the embryonic mouse corneas.

In this context, low level of expression of the normally silent alleles has been considered as genetic noise although such expression has never been further studied. Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disease involving imprinted genes, including NDN, which are only expressed from the paternally inherited allele, with the maternally inherited allele silent. We present the first in-depth study of the low expression of a normally silent imprinted allele, in pathological context. Using a variety of qualitative and quantitative approaches and comparing wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous mice deleted for Ndn, we show that, in absence of the paternal Ndn allele, the maternal Ndn allele is expressed at an extremely low level with a high degree of non-genetic heterogeneity. The level of this expression is sex-dependent and shows transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In about 50% of mutant mice, this expression reduces birth lethality and severity of the breathing deficiency, correlated with a reduction in the loss of serotonergic neurons. In wild-type brains, the maternal Ndn allele is never expressed. However, using several mouse models, we reveal a competition between non-imprinted Ndn promoters which results in monoallelic (paternal or maternal) Ndn expression, suggesting that Ndn allelic exclusion occurs in the absence of imprinting regulation. Importantly, specific expression of the maternal NDN allele is also detected in post-mortem brain samples of PWS individuals.

Analysis of reporter gene expression in Flk1 and Etv2 mutant mice further supports the hypothesis that Flk1 is necessary for Etv2 expression.

Alternative nonvenous sources of lymphatic endothelial cells have been suggested in chicken and Xenopus, but it is unclear whether they exist in mammals. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to clarify the origin of the murine dermal lymphatic vasculature. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed lineage tracing experiments and analyzed mutants lacking the Prox1 transcription factor, a master regulator of lymphatic endothelial cell identity, in Tie2 lineage venous-derived lymphatic endothelial cells. We show that, contrary to current dogma, a significant part of the dermal lymphatic vasculature forms independently of sprouting from veins. Although lymphatic vessels of cervical and thoracic skin develop via sprouting from venous-derived lymph sacs, vessels of lumbar and dorsal midline skin form via assembly of non-Tie2-lineage cells into clusters and vessels through a process defined as lymphvasculogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a significant contribution of nonvenous-derived cells to the dermal lymphatic vasculature.

The proteins are expressed in the developing brain and formed a complex in vivo based on coimmunoprecipitation experiments and coimmunostaining in primary neurons. In primary hippocampal neurons Kif20b knockdown reduced Shootin1 mobilization to the developing axon, as evidenced by immunostaining and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, suggesting that Shootin1 is a novel KIF20B cargo. shRNA targeting of Shootin1 reduced PIP3 accumulation in the growth cone, as did Kif20b shRNA. In the developing mouse brain, Kif20b knockdown or expression of the KIF20B minimal binding domain inhibited neuronal migration, and in vivo migration assays suggested that Shootin1/Kif20b acts in the same genetic pathway. Time-lapse imaging of multipolar cells in the subventricular zone revealed that downregulating levels of either Shootin1 or Kif20b hindered the transition from multipolar to bipolar cells.

These were used to assess the impact of aggrecan on growth plate organization, chondrocyte survival and proliferation, and the expression of mRNAs encoding chondrocyte differentiation markers and growth factors. Homozygous mutant (cmd(bc)/cmd(bc)) embryos exhibited severe defects in all skeletal elements with deformed and shortened (50%) limb elements. Expression of aggrecan in rescue embryos reversed the skeletal defects to varying degrees with a 20% increase in limb element length and near-full reversal (80%) of size and diameter of the ribcage and vertebrae. Aggrecan-null growth plates were devoid of matrix and lacked chondrocyte organization and differentiation, while those of the rescue embryos exhibited matrix production concomitant with partial zonation of chondrocytes having proliferative and hypertrophic morphologies. Deformation of the trachea, likely the cause of the mutation's lethality, was reduced in the rescue embryos. Aggrecan-null embryos also had abnormal patterns of COL10A1, SOX9, IHH, PTCH1, and FGFR3 mRNA expression in the growth plate. Expression of chick aggrecan in the rescue embryos notably increased COLX expression, accompanied by the reappearance of a hypertrophic zone and IHH expression. Significantly, in transgenic rescue embryos, the cell death and decreased proliferation phenotypes exhibited by the mutants were reversed; both were restored to wild-type levels.

Using the Plasmodium berghei ANKA murine model of ECM and mice deficient for the transcription factor T-bet (the master regulator of Th1 cells) on the susceptible C57BL/6 background, we demonstrate that although T-bet plays a role in the regulation of parasite burden, it also promotes the pathogenesis of ECM.

In this process, complement receptors 1 and 2 (CR1/2), expressed on B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in mice, play a central role. Complement-activating IgM administered with the antigen it is specific for, enhances the antibody response to this antigen. Here, bone marrow chimeras between Cr2(-/-) and wildtype mice were used to analyze whether FDCs or B cells must express CR1/2 for antibody responses to sheep erythrocytes (SRBC), either administered alone or together with specific IgM. For robust IgG anti-SRBC responses, CR1/2 must be expressed on FDCs. Occasionally, weak antibody responses were seen when only B cells expressed CR1/2, probably reflecting extrafollicular antibody production enabled by co-crosslinking of CR2/CD19/CD81 and the BCR. When SRBC alone was administered to mice with CR1/2(+) FDCs, B cells from wildtype and Cr2(-/-) mice produced equal amounts of antibodies. Most likely antigen is then deposited on FDCs in a way that optimizes engagement of the B cell receptor, making CR2-facilitated signaling to the B cell superfluous. SRBC bound to IgM will have more C3 fragments, the ligands for CR1/2, on their surface than SRBC administered alone. Specific IgM, forming a complex with SRBC, enhances antibody responses in two ways when FDCs express CR1/2. One is dependent on CR1/2(+) B cells and probably acts via increased transport of IgM-SRBC-complement complexes bound to CR1/2 on marginal zone B cells. The other is independent on CR1/2(+) B cells and the likely mechanism is that IgM-SRBC-complement complexes bind better to FDCs than SRBC administered alone.

However, the HMX1 pathway remains poorly understood, and in the first approach to better understand the pathway's function, we sought to identify the target genes. METHODS: We developed a predictive promoter model (PPM) approach using a comparative transcriptomic analysis in the retina at P15 of a mouse model lacking functional Hmx1 (dmbo mouse) and its respective wild-type. This PPM was based on the hypothesis that HMX1 binding site (HMX1-BS) clusters should be more represented in promoters of HMX1 target genes. The most differentially expressed genes in the microarray experiment that contained HMX1-BS clusters were used to generate the PPM, which was then statistically validated. Finally, we developed two genome-wide target prediction methods: one that focused on conserving PPM features in human and mouse and one that was based on the co-occurrence of HMX1-BS pairs fitting the PPM, in human or in mouse, independently. RESULTS: The PPM construction revealed that sarcoglycan, gamma (35kDa dystrophin-associated glycoprotein) (Sgcg), teashirt zinc finger homeobox 2 (Tshz2), and solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, glycine) (Slc6a9) genes represented Hmx1 targets in the mouse retina at P15. Moreover, the genome-wide target prediction revealed that mouse genes belonging to the retinal axon guidance pathway were targeted by Hmx1. Expression of these three genes was experimentally validated using a quantitative reverse transcription PCR approach. The inhibitory activity of Hmx1 on Sgcg, as well as protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, O (Ptpro) and Sema3f, two targets identified by the PPM, were validated with luciferase assay.

Results: Pax2-Cre N-Myc L-Myc double CKO mice show that proliferation and differentiation are linked together through Myc and in the absence of both Mycs, altered proliferation and differentiation result in morphologically abnormal ears.

PDHC is shown to produce H2O2 in relation to reducing pressure within the complex. The H2O2 produced, however, is effectively masked by a continuously cycling redox circuit that links, via glutathione/thioredoxin, to NNT, which catalyses the regeneration of NADPH from NADH at the expense of DeltaPsim. The net effect is an automatic fine-tuning of NNT-mediated energy expenditure to metabolic balance at the level of PDHC.

Most cartilage, bone, and connective tissue of the head and face is derived from neural crest cells. Hence, congenital craniofacial anomalies are often attributed to defects in neural crest cell formation, survival, migration, or differentiation.

Here, we report that Foxc1 null embryos display bony syngnathia together with defects in maxillary and mandibular structures, and agenesis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). In the absence of Foxc1, neural crest cell derived osteogenic patterning is affected, as osteoblasts develop ectopically in the maxillary prominence and fuse with the dentary bone. Furthermore, we observed that the craniofacial musculature is also perturbed in Foxc1 null mice, which highlights the complex tissue interactions required for proper jaw development.

Heterologous expression of SID-1 in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells enables passive uptake of dsRNA and subsequent soaking RNAi. Previous studies have suggested that SID-1 may serve as an RNA channel, but its precise molecular role remains unclear. To test the hypothesis that SID-1 mediates a direct biochemical recognition of RNA molecule and subsequent permeation, we expressed the extracellular domain (ECD) of SID-1 and purified it to near homogeneity. Recombinant purified SID-1 ECD selectively binds dsRNA but not dsDNA in a length-dependent and sequence-independent manner. Genetic missense mutations in SID-1 ECD causal for deficient systemic RNAi resulted in significant reduction in its affinity for dsRNA. Furthermore, full-length proteins with these mutations decrease SID-1-mediated RNA transport efficiency, providing evidence that dsRNA binding to SID-1 ECD is related to RNA transport. To examine the functional similarity of mammalian homologs of SID-1 (SIDT1 and SIDT2), we expressed and purified mouse SIDT1 and SIDT2 ECDs.

To investigate the role of miRNAs in tooth development, we examined mice with either mesenchymal (Wnt1Cre/Dicer(fl/fl) ) or epithelial (ShhCre/Dicer(fl/fl) ) conditional deletion of Dicer, which is essential for miRNA processing. Results: By using a CD1 genetic background for Wnt1Cre/Dicer(fl/fl) , we were able to examine tooth development, because the mutants retained mandible and maxilla primordia. Wnt1Cre/Dicer(fl/fl) mice showed an arrest or absence of teeth development, which varied in frequency between incisors and molars. Extra incisor tooth formation was found in ShhCre/Dicer(fl/fl) mice, whereas molars showed no significant anomalies.

First, in the bone marrow and thymus, the C terminus dampens p53 activity. Increased senescence in the Trp53(DeltaCTD/DeltaCTD) bone marrow is accompanied by up-regulation of Cdkn1 (p21). In the thymus, the C-terminal domain negatively regulates p53-dependent gene expression by inhibiting promoter occupancy.

Meanwhile, up-regulation of TbetaRI/KLF6 was observed in the fibrotic liver. Subsequent investigations validated that TbetaRI and KLF6 were direct targets of miR-101. Lentivirus-mediated ectopic expression of miR-101 in liver greatly reduced CCl4 -induced liver fibrosis, whereas intravenous administration of antisense miR-101 oligonucleotides aggravated hepatic fibrogenesis.

Here, we show that bone eminence cells are descendants of a unique set of progenitors and that superstructures are added onto the developing long bone in a modular fashion. First, we show that bone eminences emerge only after the primary cartilage rudiments have formed. Cell lineage analyses revealed that eminence cells are not descendants of chondrocytes. Moreover, eminence progenitors were specified separately and after chondroprogenitors of the primary cartilage. Fields of Sox9-positive, Scx-positive, Col2a1-negative cells identified at presumable eminence sites confirm the identity and specificity of these progenitors. The loss of eminences in limbs in which Sox9 expression was blocked in Scx-positive cells supports the hypothesis that a distinct pool of Sox9- and Scx-positive progenitors forms these superstructures. We demonstrate that TGFbeta signaling is necessary for the specification of bone eminence progenitors, whereas the SCX/BMP4 pathway is required for the differentiation of these progenitors to eminence-forming cells.

In this study, we found that Abeta42 oligomers (Abeta42O, amyloid-beta protein 1-42 oligomers) bind with high affinity to low or intermediate activation conformers of beta1-integrin, resulting in the loss of surface beta1-integrin and activation of Cofilin via Slingshot homology-1 (SSH1) activation. Specifically, conditional loss of beta1-integrin prevented Abeta42O-induced Cofilin activation, and allosteric modulation or activation of beta1-integrin significantly reduced Abeta42O binding to neurons while blocking Abeta42O-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial dysfunction, depletion of F-actin/focal Vinculin, and apoptosis. Cofilin, in turn, was required for Abeta42O-induced loss of cell surface beta1-integrin, disruption of F-actin/focal Talin-Vinculin, and depletion of F-actin-associated postsynaptic proteins. SSH1 reduction, which mitigated Cofilin activation, prevented Abeta42O-induced mitochondrial Cofilin translocation and apoptosis, while AD brain mitochondria contained significantly increased activated/oxidized Cofilin.

Blocking miRNA biosynthesis in embryonic hearts through a conditional gene inactivation approach led to differential cardiac defects depending on the Cre drivers used in different studies. The goal of this study is to reveal the cardiogenic pathway that is regulated by the miRNA mechanism at midgestation, a stage that has not been evaluated in previous publications. METHODS AND RESULTS: We specifically inactivated Dicer1, which is essential for generation of functional mature miRNAs, in the myocardium by crossing cTnt-Cre mice with Dicer1(loxP) mice. cTnt-Cre efficiently inactivates target genes in cardiomyocytes at midgestation. All mutants died between E14.5 and E16.5 with severe myocardial wall defects, including reduced cell proliferation, increased cell death, and spongy myocardial wall. Expression of TGFbeta type I receptor (Tgfbr1), which encodes the Type I receptor of TGFbeta ligands, was up-regulated in mutant hearts. As expected, TGFbeta activity was increased in Dicer1-inactivated hearts. Our further molecular analysis suggested that Tgfbr1 is a direct target of three miRNAs. Reducing TGFbeta activities using a pharmacological inhibitor on in vitro cultured hearts, or through an in vivo genetic approach, partially rescued the cardiac defects caused by Dicer1 inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time that TGFbeta signalling is directly regulated by the miRNA mechanism during myocardial wall morphogenesis. Increased TGFbeta activity plays a major role in the cardiac defects caused by myocardial deletion of Dicer1.

Herein, by knocking out Oc1 specifically in the developing retina, we show that the majority ( approximately 80%) of HCs fail to form during early retinal development, implying that Oc1 is essential for HC genesis. However, no other retinal cell types, including RGCs, were affected in the Oc1 knock-out. Analysis of the genetic relationship between Oc1 and other transcription factor genes required for HC development revealed that Oc1 functions downstream of FoxN4, in parallel with Ptf1a, but upstream of Lim1 and Prox1. By in utero electroporation, we found that Oc1 and Ptf1a together are not only essential, but also sufficient for determination of HC fate. In addition, the synaptic connections in the outer plexiform layer are defective in Oc1-null mice, and photoreceptors undergo age-dependent degeneration, indicating that HCs are not only an integral part of the retinal circuitry, but also are essential for the survival of photoreceptors.

OBJECTIVE: Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) function in VSMC differentiation from NCCs is controversial. Therefore, we determined the role and mechanism of a TGF-beta downstream signaling intermediate Smad2 in NCC differentiation to VSMCs. METHODS AND RESULTS: By using Cre/loxP system, we generated a NCC tissue-specific Smad2 knockout mouse model and found that Smad2 deletion resulted in defective NCC differentiation to VSMCs in aortic arch arteries during embryonic development and caused vessel wall abnormality in adult carotid arteries where the VSMCs are derived from NCCs. The abnormalities included 1 layer of VSMCs missing in the media of the arteries with distorted and thinner elastic lamina, leading to a thinner vessel wall compared with wild-type vessel. Mechanistically, Smad2 interacted with myocardin-related transcription factor B (MRTFB) to regulate VSMC marker gene expression. Smad2 was required for TGF-beta-induced MRTFB nuclear translocation, whereas MRTFB enhanced Smad2 binding to VSMC marker promoter. Furthermore, we found that Smad2, but not Smad3, was a progenitor-specific transcription factor mediating TGF-beta-induced VSMC differentiation from NCCs. Smad2 also seemed to be involved in determining the physiological differences between NCC-derived and mesoderm-derived VSMCs.

Loss of the DSL protein DLL3 in the mouse results in severe somite patterning defects, which are virtually indistinguishable from the defects in mice that lack lunatic fringe (LFNG), a glycosyltransferase involved in modifying Notch signaling. Like LFNG, DLL3 is located within the trans-Golgi, however, its biochemical function is still unclear.

Malformations involving the cardiac outflow tract and semilunar valves account for >50% of these cases predominantly because of a bicuspid aortic valve, which has an estimated prevalence of 1% in the population. We previously reported that mutations in NOTCH1 were a cause of bicuspid aortic valve in nonsyndromic autosomal-dominant human pedigrees. Subsequently, we described a highly penetrant mouse model of aortic valve disease, consisting of a bicuspid aortic valve with thickened cusps and associated stenosis and regurgitation, in Notch1-haploinsufficient adult mice backcrossed into a Nos3-null background. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we described the congenital cardiac abnormalities in Notch1(+/-);Nos3(-/-) embryos that led to approximately 65% lethality by postnatal day 10. Although expected Mendelian ratios of Notch1(+/-);Nos3(-/-) embryos were found at embryonic day 18.5, histological examination revealed thickened, malformed semilunar valve leaflets accompanied by additional anomalies of the cardiac outflow tract including ventricular septal defects and overriding aorta. The aortic valve leaflets of Notch1(+/-);Nos3(-/-) embryos at embryonic day 15.5 were significantly thicker than controls, consistent with a defect in remodeling of the semilunar valve cushions. In addition, we generated mice haploinsufficient for Notch1 specifically in endothelial and endothelial-derived cells in a Nos3-null background and found that Notch1(fl/+);Tie2-Cre(+/-);Nos3(-/-) mice recapitulate the congenital cardiac phenotype of Notch1(+/-);Nos3(-/-) embryos.

This role is seen, however, only in a background genetically sensitized by mutations in the pigment cell transcription factor MITF. In fact, a reduction in Pax6 gene dose exacerbates the RPE-to-retina transdifferentiation seen in embryos homozygous for an Mitf null allele, and it induces such a transdifferentiation in embryos that are either heterozygous for the Mitf null allele or homozygous for an RPE-specific hypomorphic Mitf allele generated by targeted mutation. Conversely, an increase in Pax6 gene dose interferes with transdifferentiation even in homozygous Mitf null embryos. Gene expression analyses show that, together with MITF or its paralog TFEC, PAX6 suppresses the expression of Fgf15 and Dkk3.

However, the mechanisms that underlie partitioning of the genome into TADs remain poorly understood. Here we show by chromosome conformation capture (capture Hi-C and 4C-seq methods) that genomic duplications in patient cells and genetically modified mice can result in the formation of new chromatin domains (neo-TADs) and that this process determines their molecular pathology. Duplications of non-coding DNA within the mouse Sox9 TAD (intra-TAD) that cause female to male sex reversal in humans, showed increased contact of the duplicated regions within the TAD, but no change in the overall TAD structure. In contrast, overlapping duplications that extended over the next boundary into the neighbouring TAD (inter-TAD), resulted in the formation of a new chromatin domain (neo-TAD) that was isolated from the rest of the genome. As a consequence of this insulation, inter-TAD duplications had no phenotypic effect. However, incorporation of the next flanking gene, Kcnj2, in the neo-TAD resulted in ectopic contacts of Kcnj2 with the duplicated part of the Sox9 regulatory region, consecutive misexpression of Kcnj2, and a limb malformation phenotype. Our findings provide evidence that TADs are genomic regulatory units with a high degree of internal stability that can be sculptured by structural genomic variations.

The increase of the IP pool is mediated by the interaction between Axin and GSK-3 in the cytoplasmic compartments of the progenitors. Importantly, as development proceeds, Axin becomes enriched in the nucleus to trigger neuronal differentiation via beta-catenin activation.

We hypothesized that adipokine leptin worsens sinusoidal injury by decreasing functionally active nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS)3 via miR21. Using rodent models of NASH, and transgenic mice lacking leptin and leptin receptor, results showed that hyperleptinemia caused a 4-5 fold upregulation of hepatic miR21 as assessed by qRTPCR. The upregulation of miR21 led to a time-dependent repression of its target protein Grhl3 levels as shown by western blot analyses. NOS3-p/NOS3 ratio which is controlled by Grhl3 was significantly decreased in NASH models. SED markers ICAM-1, VEGFR-2, and E-selectin as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy were significantly up regulated in the progressive phases of NASH. Lack of leptin or its receptor in vivo, reversed the upregulation of miR21 and restored the levels of Grhl3 and NOS3-p/NOS3 ratio coupled with decreased SED dysfunction markers. Interestingly, leptin supplementation in mice lacking leptin, significantly enhanced miR21 levels, decreased Grhl3 repression and NOS3 phosphorylation. Leptin supplementation in isolated primary endothelial cells, Kupffer cells and stellate cells showed increased mir21 expression in stellate cells while sinusoidal injury was significantly higher in all cell types. Finally miR21 KO mice showed increased NOS3-p/NOS3 ratio and reversed SED markers in the rodent models of NASH.

Forced expression of SMAD7 in beta cells by itself was sufficient to promote beta-cell proliferation in vivo. M2, rather than M1 macrophages, seem to be the inducers of SMAD7-mediated beta-cell proliferation. M2 macrophages not only release TGFbeta1 to directly induce up-regulation of SMAD7 in beta cells but also release EGF to activate EGF receptor signaling that inhibits TGFbeta1-activated SMAD2 nuclear translocation, resulting in TGFbeta signaling inhibition.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We used TRPM4 knockout mice and performed patch-clamp experiments, membrane potential measurements, microfluorometry, contractility measurements, and in vivo pressure-volume loop analysis. We demonstrate that TRPM4 proteins are functionally present in mouse ventricular myocytes and are activated on Ca2+ -induced Ca2+ release. In Trpm4(-/-) mice, cardiac muscle displays an increased beta-adrenergic inotropic response both in vitro and in vivo. Measurements of action potential duration show a significantly decreased time for 50% and 90% repolarization in Trpm4(-/-) ventricular myocytes. We provide evidence that this change in action potential shape leads to an increased driving force for the L-type Ca2+ current during the action potential, which explains the altered contractility of the heart muscle.

METHODS AND RESULTS: IL-1beta protein was measured in human TAAs and control aortas, and IL-1beta protein was increased approximately 20-fold in human TAAs. To develop an experimental model of TAAs, 8- to 10-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice (wild type [WT]) underwent thoracotomy with application of periadventitial elastase (WT TAA) or saline (WT control; n=30 per group). Elastase treatment to thoracic aortas resulted in progressive dilation until day 14 with maximal dilation of 99.6+/-24.7% compared with 14.4+/-8.2% for WT saline control (P<0.0001). WT TAAs demonstrated elastin fragmentation, smooth muscle cell loss, macrophage infiltration, and increased IL-1beta expression. Next, TAAs were induced in mice deficient of IL-1beta (IL-1beta knockout) or IL-1 receptor (IL-1R knockout; n=10 each). Genetic deletion of IL-1beta and IL-1R significantly decreased thoracic aortic dilation (IL-1beta knockout=54.2+/-16.8% and IL-1R knockout=62.6+/-17.2% versus WT TAA=104.7+/-23.8%; P<0.001for both).

Separately, WT mice pretreated with either IL-1R antagonist anakinra (100 mg/kg per day) or vehicle alone (control) underwent elastase treatment. Pretreatment of WT mice with anakinra attenuated TAA formation (control: 99.2+/-15.5% versus anakinra: 68.3+/-19.2%; P<0.005).

We examined direct effects of Ang II on carotid arteries from SOCS3-deficient (SOCS3(+/-)) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates using organ culture and then tested endothelial function with acetylcholine (ACh). A low concentration of Ang II (1 nmol/l) did not affect ACh-induced vasodilation in WT but reduced that of SOCS3(+/-) mice by approximately 50% (P < 0.05). In relation to mechanisms, effects of Ang II in SOCS3(+/-) mice were prevented by inhibitors of STAT3, IL-6, NF-kappaB, or superoxide. Systemic Ang II (1.4 mg/kg per day for 14 days) also reduced vasodilation to ACh in WT. Surprisingly, SOCS3 deficiency prevented most of the endothelial dysfunction. To examine potential underlying mechanisms, we performed bone marrow transplantation.

Sixteen mammalian CA isozymes are currently known. To understand the specific roles of CA isozymes in the inner ear, a systematic survey was conducted to reveal temporal and spatial expression patterns of all 16 CA isozymes during inner ear development. Results: Our quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results showed that different tissues express unique combinations of CA isozymes. During inner ear development, transcripts of four cytosolic isozymes (Car1, Car2, Car3, and Car13), two membrane-bound isozymes (Car12 and Car14), and two CA-related proteins (Car8 and Car11) were expressed at higher levels than other isozymes. Spatial expression patterns of these isozymes within developing inner ears were determined by in situ hybridization. Each isozyme showed a unique expression pattern during development. For example, Car12 and Car13 expression closely overlapped with Pendrin, an anion exchanger, while Car2 overlapped with Na-K-ATPase in type II and IV otic fibrocytes, suggesting functional relationships in the inner ear.

FXR is protective against carcinogenesis and inflammation in liver and intestine as demonstrated by the development of inflammation and tumors in the liver and intestine of FXR knock-out mice. However, mechanisms for the protective effects of FXR are not completely understood. This study reports a novel role of FXR in regulating expression of Sqstm1, which encodes for p62 protein. p62 plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through selective autophagy and activating signal transduction pathways, such as NF-kappaB to support cell survival and caspase-8 to initiate apoptosis. FXR regulation of Sqstm1 may serve as a protective mechanism. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study showed that FXR bound to the Sqstm1 gene in both mouse livers and ileums as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. In addition, FXR activation enhanced transcriptional activation of Sqstm1 in vitro. However, wild-type mice treated with GW4064, a synthetic FXR ligand, showed that FXR activation induced mRNA and protein expression of Sqstm1/p62 in ileum, but not in liver. Interestingly, FXR-transgenic mice showed induced mRNA expression of Sqstm1 in both liver and ileum compared to wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our current study has identified a novel role of FXR in regulating the expression of p62, a key factor in protein degradation and cell signaling.

Recent evidence shows that functional blockade of Notch1 and its ligand, Dll4, leads to postnatal lymphatic defects in mice. However, the precise role of the Notch signaling pathway in lymphatic vessel development has yet to be defined. Here we show the developmental role of Notch1 in lymphatic vascular morphogenesis by analyzing lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)-specific conditional Notch1 knockout mice crossed with an inducible Prox1CreER(T2) driver. RESULTS: LEC-specific Notch1 mutant embryos exhibited enlarged lymphatic vessels. The phenotype of lymphatic overgrowth accords with increased LEC sprouting from the lymph sacs and increased filopodia formation. Furthermore, cell death was significantly reduced in Notch1-mutant LECs, whereas proliferation was increased. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of cytokine/chemokine signaling molecules was upregulated in Notch1-mutant LECs isolated from E15.5 dorsal skin, whereas VEGFR3, VEGFR2, VEGFC, and Gja4 (Connexin 37) were downregulated. CONCLUSIONS: The lymphatic phenotype of LEC-specific conditional Notch1 mouse mutants indicates that Notch activity in LECs controls lymphatic sprouting and growth during development. These results provide evidence that similar to postnatal and pathological lymphatic vessel formation, the Notch signaling pathway plays a role in inhibiting developmental lymphangiogenesis.

However, how Runx2 regulation of Col10a1 expression impacts chondrocyte maturation, an essential step of endochondral bone formation, remains unknown. We have recently generated transgenic mice in which Flag-tagged Runx2 was driven by a cell-specific Col10a1 control element. Significantly increased level of Runx2 and Col10a1 mRNA transcripts were detected in transgenic mouse limbs at both E17.5 (embryonic day 17.5) and P1 (post-natal day1) stages, suggesting an in vivo correlation of Runx2 and Col10a1 expression. Surprisingly, skeletal staining suggested delayed ossification in both the axial and the appendicular skeleton of transgenic mice from E14.5 until P6. Histological analysis showed elongated hypertrophic zones in transgenic mice, with less von Kossa and TUNEL staining in long bone sections at both E17.5 and P1 stages, suggesting defective mineralization due to delayed chondrocyte maturation or apoptosis. Indeed, we detected increased level of anti-apoptotic genes B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2, Osteopontin, and Sox9 in transgenic mice by real-time RT-PCR. Moreover, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analysis also suggested increased Sox9 expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes of transgenic mice. Together, our data suggest that targeting Runx2 in hypertrophic chondrocytes upregulates expression of Col10a1 and other marker genes (such as Sox9). This will change the local matrix environment, delay chondrocyte maturation, reduce apoptosis and matrix mineralization, and eventually, lead to impaired endochondral ossification. J. Cell.

This study demonstrates that DHRS3 requires the presence of retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10) to display its full catalytic activity. The RDH10-activated DHRS3 acts as a robust high affinity all-trans-retinaldehyde-specific reductase that effectively converts retinaldehyde back to retinol, decreasing the rate of retinoic acid biosynthesis.

The present study tested the hypothesis that in mouse adipose tissue, endogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) negatively regulates inflammation via activation of prostaglandin E receptor 4 (EP4). PGE2 (5-500 nM) attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced mRNA and protein expression of chemokines, including interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 and macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha in mouse adipose tissue. A selective EP4 antagonist (L161,982) reversed, and two structurally different selective EP4 agonists [CAY10580 and CAY10598] mimicked these actions of PGE2. Adipose tissue derived from EP4-deficient mice did not display this response. These findings establish the involvement of EP4 receptors in this anti-inflammatory response. Experiments performed on adipose tissue from high-fat-fed mice demonstrated EP4-dependent attenuation of chemokine production during diet-induced obesity. The anti-inflammatory actions of EP4 became more important on a high-fat diet, in that EP4 activation suppressed a greater variety of chemokines. Furthermore, adipose tissue and systemic inflammation was enhanced in high-fat-fed EP4-deficient mice compared with wild-type littermates, and in high-fat-fed untreated C57BL/6 mice compared with mice treated with EP4 agonist.

Hepatic expression of platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C) induces progressive fibrosis, chronic inflammation, neoangiogenesis and sinusoidal congestion, as well as global changes in gene expression. Using reporter mice, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and liver cell isolation, we demonstrate that receptors for PDGF-CC are localized on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which proliferate, and transform into myofibroblast-like cells that deposit extracellular matrix and lead to production of growth factors and cytokines. We demonstrate induction of cytokine genes at 2 months, and stromal cell-derived hepatocyte growth factors that coincide with the onset of dysplasia at 4 months.

The checkpoint protein ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) localizes to unsynapsed chromosomes, but its role in the initiation and maintenance of meiotic silencing is unknown. Here we show that ATR has multiple roles in silencing. ATR first regulates HORMA (Hop1, Rev7, and Mad2) domain protein HORMAD1/2 phosphorylation and localization of breast cancer I (BRCA1) and ATR cofactors ATR-interacting peptide (ATRIP)/topoisomerase 2-binding protein 1 (TOPBP1) at unsynapsed axes.

Finally, ATR catalyzes histone H2AFX phosphorylation, the epigenetic event leading to gene inactivation. Using a novel genetic strategy in which MSCI is used to silence a chosen gene in pachytene, we show that ATR depletion does not disrupt the maintenance of silencing and that silencing comprises two phases: The first is dynamic and reversible, and the second is stable and irreversible.

In this study, we found that c-Kit is functionally expressed in both osteoblastic-like MC3T3-E1 cells and primary murine osteoblasts. Its ligand SCF exerted significant cyto-protective effects against hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). SCF activated its receptor c-Kit in osteoblasts, which was required for its cyto-protective effects against H(2)O(2). Pharmacological inhibition (by Imatinib and Dasatinib) or shRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Kit thus inhibited SCF-mediated osteoblast protection. Further investigations showed that protection by SCF against H(2)O(2) was mediated via activation of c-Kit-dependent Akt pathway. Inhibition of Akt activation, through pharmacological or genetic means, suppressed SCF-mediated anti-H(2)O(2) activity in osteoblasts.

However, the specificity of cre expression has recently been questioned, and the time of its onset during megakaryopoiesis remains unknown. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: To characterize the expression of this transgene, we used double-fluorescent cre reporter mice. RESULTS: In the bone marrow, Pf4-cre-mediated recombination had occurred in all CD42-positive megakaryocytes as early as stage I of maturation, and in rare CD42-negative cells. In circulating blood, all platelets had recombined, along with only a minor fraction of CD45-positive cells. However, we found that all tissues contained recombined cells of monocyte/macrophage origin. When recombined, these cells might potentially modify the function of the tissues under particular conditions, especially inflammatory conditions, which further increase recombination in immune cells. Unexpectedly, a subset of epithelial cells from the distal colon showed signs of recombination resulting from endogenous Pf4-cre expression. This is probably the basis of the unexplained colon tumors developed by Apc(flox/flox) ;Pf4-cre mice, generated in a separate study on the role of Apc in platelet formation. CONCLUSION: Altogether, our results indicate early recombination with full penetrance in megakaryopoiesis, and confirm the value of Pf4-cre mice for the genetic engineering of megakaryocytes and platelets.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed a marked potentiation of the inward current responses both to ATP and the prototypic P2X7 receptor agonist dibenzoyl-ATP (Bz-ATP) at low Ca(2+) and zero Mg(2+) concentrations in the bath medium. The Bz-ATP-induced currents reversed their polarity near 0 mV; in NPCs prepared from P2X7(-/-) mice, Bz-ATP failed to elicit membrane currents. The general P2X/P2Y receptor antagonist PPADS and the P2X7 selective antagonists Brilliant Blue G and A-438079 strongly depressed the effect of Bz-ATP. Long-lasting application of Bz-ATP induced an initial current, which slowly increased to a steady-state response. In combination with the determination of YO-PRO uptake, these experiments suggest the dilation of a receptor-channel and/or the recruitment of a dye-uptake pathway. Ca(2+)-imaging by means of Fura-2 revealed that in a Mg(2+)-deficient bath medium Bz-ATP causes [Ca(2+)](i) transients fully depending on the presence of external Ca(2+). The MTT test indicated a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability by Bz-ATP treatment. Correspondingly, Bz-ATP led to an increase in active caspase 3 immunoreactivity, indicating a P2X7-controlled apoptosis.

Deletion of PAQR3 leads to reduction of exercise-induced autophagy in mice, accompanied by a certain degree of disaggregation of ATG14L-associated VPS34 complex. Together, this study uncovers that PAQR3 can not only enhance the capacity of pro-autophagy class III PI3K due to its scaffold function, but also integrate AMPK signal to activation of ATG14L-linked VPS34 complex upon glucose starvation.", "publish_time": "2016-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"residual": 1, "line chart": 7, "3D structure": 1, "other diagram": 6, "gel/blot": 2, "macromolecule sequence": 25}}, "5638299": {"cord_uid": "5638299", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Role of Foxl2 in uterine maturation and function.", "abstract": "Foxl2 codes for a forkhead/HNF3 transcription factor essential for follicular maturation and maintenance of ovarian identity.

We show that Foxl2 is not only expressed by the ovary, but also by other components of the mouse female reproductive tract, including the uterus, the cervix and the oviduct. In the uterus, Foxl2 expression is first observed in the neonatal mesenchyme and, during uterine maturation, persists in the stroma and in the deep inner myometrial layer (IML). In the adult, Foxl2 is expressed in the differentiated stromal layer, but no longer in the myometrium. Conditional deletion of Foxl2 in the postnatal (PN) uterus using Progesterone Receptor-cre (Pgr(cre/+)) mice results in infertility.

Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) slices, we found that tetanic stimulation (TS) of excitatory afferents with a naturally occurring frequency (10 min at 13 Hz) reliably induces a mGluR1/5-dependent long-term depression (mGluR1/5-LTD) of excitatory synaptic transmission. Blockade of NMDAR during but not after TS showed enhanced mGluR1/5-LTD induction, which is associated with its antagonism of TS-induced calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation. The ability of NMDAR antagonists to promote mGluR1/5-LTD induction was mimicked by a selective CaMKII inhibitor KN-62.

These results indicate that synaptically released glutamate during TS of excitatory afferents can activate both NMDAR and mGluR1/5 in NAc neurons concomitantly and that activation of NMDAR may stimulate CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of Homer1b/c and impair the interaction between mGluR5 and Homer1b/c, thereby attenuating mGluR1/5-LTD induction.

The hedgehog genes encode extracellular signaling proteins responsible for patterning and tissue formation during embryogenesis. Signal transduction of this pathway is mediated through activation of the transmembrane proteins smoothened and patched, stimulating downstream signaling resulting in the activation or repression of hedgehog target genes. Hedgehog signaling is implicated in eye development, and defects in hedgehog signaling components have been shown to result in defects of the retina, iris, and lens. METHODS: We assessed the consequences of constitutive hedgehog signaling in the developing mouse lens using Cre-LoxP technology to express the conditional M2 smoothened allele in the embryonic head and lens ectoderm. RESULTS: Although initial lens development appeared normal, morphological defects were apparent by E12.5 and became more significant at later stages of embryogenesis. Altered lens morphology correlated with ectopic expression of FoxE3, which encodes a critical gene required for human and mouse lens development. Later, inappropriate expression of the epithelial marker Pax6, and as well as fiber cell markers c-maf and Prox1 also occurred, indicating a failure of appropriate lens fiber cell differentiation accompanied by altered lens cell proliferation and cell death.

In this study, we examined the corneal defects in Fgfr2 conditional knockout mice in which Cre expression is activated at lens induction stage by Pax6 P0 promoter. The cornea in LeCre, Fgfr2(loxP/loxP) mice (referred as Fgfr2(CKO)) was analyzed to assess changes in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. We found that Fgfr2(CKO) cornea was much thinner in epithelial and stromal layer when compared to WT cornea.

At later stage, cell differentiation markers for corneal epithelium and underlying stromal mesenchyme, keratin-12 and keratocan respectively, were not expressed in Fgfr2(CKO) cornea. Furthermore, Pax6, a transcription factor essential for eye development, was not present in the Fgfr2(CKO) mutant corneal epithelial at E16.5 but was expressed normally at E12.5, suggesting that FGFR2-signaling is required for maintaining Pax6 expression in this tissue. Interestingly, the role of FGFR2 in corneal epithelial development is independent of ERK1/2-signaling. In contrast to the lens, FGFR2 is not required for cell survival in cornea.

Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), a major nodal signal transducer in innate immunity, can play a pivotal role in host inflammatory response. We sought to determine how IRAK4 modulates inflammation and outcome in a mouse model of viral myocarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Myocarditis was induced after intraperitoneal inoculation of coxsackievirus B3 into C57Bl/6 IRAK4-deficient mice and their littermate controls. Mortality and viral proliferation were markedly reduced in IRAK4(-/-) mice compared with their IRAK4(+/+) littermates. Disease resistance of IRAK4(-/-) mice paralleled increased amounts of protective heart-infiltrating CCR5(+) monocytes/macrophages and enhanced interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma production 2 days after infection. Competitive bone marrow chimera demonstrated that intact IRAK4 function inhibited heart-specific migration of bone marrow-derived CCR5(+) cells. Mechanistically, lack of IRAK4 resulted in interferon regulatory factor 5 homodimerization via reduced melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 degradation and enhanced Stat1 and Stat5 phosphorylation. Consequently, antiviral interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma production, as well as CCR5(+) cell recruitment, increased, whereas the overall proinflammatory response was drastically reduced in the absence of IRAK4. CONCLUSIONS: Innate immunity signal transducer IRAK4 exacerbates viral myocarditis through inhibition of interferon production and reduced mobilization of protective CCR5(+) monocytes/macrophages to the heart.

Furthermore, selective inhibition of VEGFR2 kinase activity and exposure to a neonatal NEC protocol significantly decreased the density of the intestinal microvascular network, which was further reduced when both interventions were provided together.

RESULTS: To study HSPG-dependent coordination of these signaling pathways during mammalian visual system development, we have generated a series of OV-specific mutations in the heparan sulfate (HS) N-sulfotransferase genes (Ndst1 and Ndst2) and HS O-sulfotransferase genes (Hs2st, Hs6st1, and Hs6st2) in mice. Of interest, the resulting HS undersulfation still allowed for normal retinal neurogenesis and optic fissure closure, but led to defective optic disc and stalk development. The adult mutant animals further developed optic nerve aplasia/hypoplasia and displayed retinal degeneration. We observed that MAPK/ERK signaling was down-regulated in Ndst mutants, and consistent with this, HS-related optic nerve morphogenesis defects in mutant mice could partially be rescued by constitutive Kras activation.

Trehalose is a disaccharide known to possess many pharmacological properties, acting as an antioxidant, a chemical chaperone, and an inducer of autophagy. In this study, we analyzed at an early postnatal development stage the abnormalities observed in striatal glial cell cultures of postnatal R6/1 mice (HD glia), under baseline and stressing conditions and the protective effects of trehalose. Our data demonstrate that glial HD alterations already occur at early stages of postnatal development. After 20 postnatal days in vitro, striatal HD glia cultures showed more reactive astrocytes with increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) but with less replication capacity, less A2B5(+) glial progenitors and more microglia than wild-type (WT) cultures. HD glia had lower levels of intracellular glutathione (GSH) and was more susceptible to H2O2 and epoxomicin insults. The amount of expressed GDNF and secreted mature-BDNF by HD astrocytes were much lower than by WT astrocytes. In addition, HD glial cultures showed a deregulation of the major proteolytic systems, the ubiquitin-proteasomal system (UPS), and the autophagic pathway.

In addition, trehalose up-regulated mature-BDNF neurotrophic factor expression and secretion, probably mediating cytoskeletal organization and helping in vesicular BDNF transport. Together, these findings indicate that glia suffers functional early changes in the disease process, changes that may contribute to HD neurodegeneration.

In order to more fully define the developmental roles of Hox genes it is necessary to remove multiple combinations of paralogous and flanking genes. In addition, the downstream molecular pathways regulated by Hox genes during limb development remain incompletely delineated. RESULTS: In this report we examine limb development in mice with frameshift mutations in six Hox genes, Hoxa9,10,11 and Hoxd9,10,11. The mice were made with a novel recombineering method that allows the simultaneous targeting of frameshift mutations into multiple flanking genes. The Hoxa9,10,11 (-/-) /Hoxd9,10,11 (-/-) mutant mice show a reduced ulna and radius that is more severe than seen in Hoxa11 (-/-)/Hoxd11 (-/-) mice, indicating a minor role for the flanking Hox9,10 genes in zeugopod development, as well as their primary function in stylopod development. The mutant mice also show severe reduction of Shh expression in the zone of polarizing activity, and decreased Fgf8 expression in the apical ectodermal ridge, thereby better defining the roles of these specific Hox genes in the regulation of critical signaling centers during limb development. Importantly, we also used laser capture microdissection coupled with RNA-Seq to characterize the gene expression programs in wild type and mutant limbs. Resting, proliferative and hypertrophic compartments of E15.5 forelimb zeugopods were examined. The results provide an RNA-Seq characterization of the progression of gene expression patterns during normal endochondral bone formation. In addition of the Hox mutants showed strongly altered expression of Pknox2, Zfp467, Gdf5, Bmpr1b, Dkk3, Igf1, Hand2, Shox2, Runx3, Bmp7 and Lef1, all of which have been previously shown to play important roles in bone formation. CONCLUSIONS: The recombineering based frameshift mutation of the six flanking and paralogous Hoxa9,10,11 and Hoxd9,10,11 genes provides a resource for the analysis of their overlapping functions. Analysis of the Hoxa9,10,11 (-/-) /Hoxd9,10,11 (-/-) mutant limbs confirms and extends the results of previous studies using mice with Hox mutations in single paralogous groups or with entire Hox cluster deletions.

As an important transcription factor, zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) play important roles in many cell functions, including development, differentiation, tumorigenesis, and functions of the immune system. However, the role of ZFP members in the innate immune responses remains unclear. Here we showed that the expression of C2H2-type ZFP, ZFP64, was significantly up-regulated in macrophages upon stimulation with TLR ligands, including LPS, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, or poly(I:C). ZFP64 overexpression promoted TLR-triggered TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IFN-beta production in macrophages. Coincidently, knockdown of ZFP64 expression significantly inhibited the production of the above cytokines. However, activation of MAPK and IRF3 was not responsible for the ZFP64-mediated promotion of cytokine production. Interestingly, ZFP64 significantly up-regulated TLR-induced NF-kappaB activation. ZFP64 could bind to the promoter of the TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IFN-beta genes in macrophages only after TLR ligation. Furthermore, ZFP64 associated with the NF-kappaB p65 subunit upon LPS stimulation, and TLR-ligated macrophages showed a lower level of p65 recruitment to the TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IFN-beta gene promoter in the absence of ZFP64. The data identify ZFP64 as a downstream positive regulator of TLR-initiated innate immune responses by associating with the NF-kappaB p65 subunit, enhancing p65 recruitment to the target gene promoters and increasing p65 activation and, thus, leading to the promotion of TLR-triggered proinflammatory cytokine and type I interferon production.

The transcription factor Otx2 plays a crucial role in mesencephalic development by positioning the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) and its organizing activity. Here, we investigated whether Otx2 is cell-autonomously required to control identity and fate of dorsal mesencephalic progenitors. With this aim, we have inactivated Otx2 in the Pax7(+) dorsal mesencephalic domain, previously named m1, without affecting MHB integrity. We found that the Pax7(+) m1 domain can be further subdivided into a dorsal Zic1(+) m1a and a ventral Zic1(-) m1b sub-domain. Loss of Otx2 in the m1a (Pax7(+) Zic1(+)) sub-domain impairs the identity and fate of progenitors, which undergo a full switch into a coordinated cerebellum differentiation program.

CXCL12 (50 nM) powerfully inhibited firing independently of synaptic transmission, suggesting that CXCR4 regulates an intrinsic conductance.

Notably, the number of Lgr5(+) cells was remarkably increased in intestinal metaplasia. In total, 76% of gastric adenomas and 43% of early gastric carcinomas were positive for LGR5. Lgr5(+) cells were found more frequently in low-grade tumors with active Wnt signaling and an intestinal gland type, suggesting that LGR5 is likely involved in the very early stages of Wnt-driven tumorigenesis in the stomach. Interestingly, similar to stem cells in normal tissues, Lgr5(+) cells were often restricted to the base of the tumor glands, and such Lgr5(+) restriction was associated with high levels of intestinal stem cell markers such as EPHB2, OLFM4, and ASCL2. Thus, our findings show that Lgr5(+) cells are present at the base of the antral glands in the human stomach and that this cell population significantly expands in intestinal metaplasias. Furthermore, Lgr5(+) cells are seen in a large number of gastric tumors ; their frequent basal arrangements and coexpression of ISC markers support the idea that Lgr5(+) cells act as stem cells during the early stage of intestinal-type gastric tumorigenesis.", "publish_time": "2013-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 9, "3D structure": 4, "other diagram": 4, "macromolecule sequence": 1, "fluorescence": 33, "gel/blot": 6}}, "5607448": {"cord_uid": "5607448", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Mastl is required for timely activation of APC/C in meiosis I and Cdk1 reactivation in meiosis II.", "abstract": "In mitosis, the Greatwall kinase (called microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase like [Mastl] in mammals) is essential for prometaphase entry or progression by suppressing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity.

To clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms, the density of AMPARs, PSD-95, and transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs) were compared at Schaffer collateral/commissural (SCC) synapses in the adult mouse hippocampal CA1 by quantitative immunogold electron microscopy using serial sections. We examined four types of SCC synapses: perforated and nonperforated synapses on pyramidal cells and axodendritic synapses on parvalbumin-positive (PV synapse) and pravalbumin-negative interneurons (non-PV synapse). SCC synapses were categorized into those expressing high-density (perforated and PV synapses) or low-density (nonperforated and non-PV synapses) AMPARs. Although the density of PSD-95 labeling was fairly constant, the density and composition of TARP isoforms was highly variable depending on the synapse type. Of the three TARPs expressed in hippocampal neurons, the disparity in TARP gamma-2 labeling was closely related to that of AMPAR labeling. Importantly, AMPAR density was significantly reduced at perforated and PV synapses in TARP gamma-2-knock-out (KO) mice, resulting in a virtual loss of AMPAR disparity among SCC synapses. In comparison, TARP gamma-8 was the only TARP expressed at nonperforated synapses, where AMPAR labeling further decreased to a background level in TARP gamma-8-KO mice. These results show that synaptic inclusion of TARP gamma-2 potently increases AMPAR expression and transforms low-density synapses into high-density ones, whereas TARP gamma-8 is essential for low-density or basal expression of AMPARs at nonperforated synapses. Therefore, these TARPs are critically involved in AMPAR density control at SCC synapses. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Although converging evidence implicates the importance of transmembrane AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) regulatory proteins (TARPs) in AMPAR stabilization during basal transmission and synaptic plasticity, how they control large disparities in AMPAR numbers or densities across central synapses remains largely unknown. We compared the density of AMPARs with that of TARPs among four types of Schaffer collateral/commissural (SCC) hippocampal synapses in wild-type and TARP-knock-out mice. We show that the density of AMPARs correlates with that of TARP gamma-2 across SCC synapses and its high expression is linked to high-density AMPAR expression at perforated type of pyramidal cell synapses and synapses on parvalbumin-positive interneurons.

We therefore sought to clarify the role of the immune system in mediating the efficacy of HDACi in a physiologic setting, using preclinical, syngeneic murine models of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. We showed an intact immune system was required for the robust anticancer effects of the HDACi vorinostat and panobinostat against a colon adenocarcinoma and two aggressive models of leukemia/lymphoma. Importantly, although HDACi-treated immunocompromised mice bearing established lymphoma succumbed to disease significantly earlier than tumor bearing, HDACi-treated wild-type (WT) mice, treatment with the conventional chemotherapeutic etoposide equivalently enhanced the survival of both strains. IFN-gamma and tumor cell signaling through IFN-gammaR were particularly important for the anticancer effects of HDACi, and vorinostat and IFN-gamma acted in concert to enhance the immunogenicity of tumor cells.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that polarity proteins also contribute to endothelial processes like angiogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Screening of endothelial cells revealed high expression of the polarity protein Scribble (Scrib). On fibronectin-coated carriers Scrib siRNA (siScrib) blocked directed but not random migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and led to an increased number and disturbed orientation of cellular lamellipodia. Coimmunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assays identified integrin alpha5 as a novel Scrib interacting protein. By total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, Scrib and integrin alpha5 colocalize at the basal plasma membrane of endothelial cells. Western blot and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed that silencing of Scrib reduced the protein amount and surface expression of integrin alpha5 whereas surface expression of integrin alphaV was unaffected. Moreover, in contrast to fibronectin, the ligand of integrin alpha5, directional migration on collagen mediated by collagen-binding integrins was unaffected by siScrib. Mechanistically, Scrib supported integrin alpha5 recycling and protein stability by blocking its interaction with Rab7a, its translocation into lysosomes, and its subsequent degradation by pepstatin-sensitive proteases. In siScrib-treated cells, reinduction of the wild-type protein but not of PSD95, Dlg, ZO-1 (PDZ), or leucine rich repeat domain mutants restored integrin alpha5 abundance and directional cell migration.

The lineage-determining factor MyoD is bound to myogenic genes at the onset of differentiation whether gene activation is immediate or delayed. How temporal regulation of differentiation-specific genes is established remains unclear. RESULTS: Using embryonic tissue, we addressed the molecular differences in the organization of the myogenin and muscle creatine kinase (MCK) gene promoters by examining regulatory factor binding as a function of both time and spatial organization during somitogenesis. At the myogenin promoter, binding of the homeodomain factor Pbx1 coincided with H3 hyperacetylation and was followed by binding of co-activators that modulate chromatin structure. MyoD and myogenin binding occurred subsequently, demonstrating that Pbx1 facilitates chromatin remodeling and modification before myogenic regulatory factor binding. At the same time, the MCK promoter was bound by HDAC2 and MyoD, and activating histone marks were largely absent. The association of HDAC2 and MyoD was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, proximity ligation assay (PLA), and sequential ChIP. CONCLUSIONS: MyoD differentially promotes activated and repressed chromatin structures at myogenic genes early after the onset of skeletal muscle differentiation in the developing mouse embryo.

TGFbeta signaling, which is mediated by Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways, plays a crucial role in regulating craniofacial development and patterning, particularly in palate development. However, it remains largely unknown whether the Smad-independent pathway contributes to TGFbeta signaling function during palatogenesis. In this study, we investigated the function of TGFbeta activated kinase 1 (Tak1), a key regulator of Smad-independent TGFbeta signaling in palate development. We show that Tak1 protein is expressed in both the epithelium and mesenchyme of the developing palatal shelves. Whereas deletion of Tak1 in the palatal epithelium or mesenchyme did not give rise to a cleft palate defect, inactivation of Tak1 in the neural crest lineage using the Wnt1-Cre transgenic allele resulted in failed palate elevation and subsequently the cleft palate formation. The failure in palate elevation in Wnt1-Cre;Tak1(F/F) mice results from a malformed tongue and micrognathia, resembling human Pierre Robin sequence cleft of the secondary palate. We found that the abnormal tongue development is associated with Fgf10 overexpression in the neural crest-derived tongue tissue. The failed palate elevation and cleft palate were recapitulated in an Fgf10-overexpressing mouse model. The repressive effect of the Tak1-mediated noncanonical TGFbeta signaling on Fgf10 expression was further confirmed by inhibition of p38, a downstream kinase of Tak1, in the primary cell culture of developing tongue.

Cellular senescence contributes to age-related tissue dysfunction, but the epigenetic basis underlying drug-induced senescence remains unclear. macroH2A1, a variant of histone H2A, is a marker of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci that synergizes with DNA methylation to silence tumor-suppressor genes in human fibroblasts. In this study, we investigated the relationship between macroH2A1 splice variants, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, and liver carcinogenesis. We found that protein levels of both macroH2A1 isoforms were increased in the livers of very elderly rodents and humans, and were robust immunohistochemical markers of human cirrhosis and HCC. In response to the chemotherapeutic and DNA-demethylating agent 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), transgenic expression of macroH2A1 isoforms in HCC cell lines prevented the emergence of a senescent-like phenotype and induced synergistic global DNA hypomethylation. Conversely, macroH2A1 depletion amplified the antiproliferative effects of 5-aza-dC in HCC cells, but failed to enhance senescence. Senescence-associated secretory phenotype and whole-transcriptome analyses implicated the p38 MAPK/IL8 pathway in mediating macroH2A1-dependent escape of HCC cells from chemotherapy-induced senescence. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed that this hepatic antisenescence state also required active transcription that could not be attributed to genomic occupancy of these histones. Collectively, our findings reveal a new mechanism by which drug-induced senescence is epigenetically regulated by macroH2A1 and DNA methylation and suggest macroH2A1 as a novel biomarker of hepatic senescence that could potentially predict prognosis and disease progression.

One intriguing consequence of Eph signaling is the control of mixing between discrete cell populations in the developing hindbrain, contributing to the formation of segregated rhombomeres. Since the thalamus is also a parcellated structure comprised of discrete nuclei, might Eph signaling play a parallel role in cell segregation in this brain structure? Analyses of expression reveal that several Eph family members are expressed in the forming thalamus and that cells expressing particular receptors form cellular groupings as development proceeds. Specifically, expression of receptors EphA4 or EphA7 and ligand ephrin-A5 is localized to distinct thalamic domains. EphA4 and EphA7 are often coexpressed in regions of the forming thalamus, with each receptor marking discrete thalamic domains. In contrast, ephrin-A5 is expressed by a limited group of thalamic cells. Within the ventral thalamus, EphA4 is present broadly, occasionally overlapping with ephrin-A5 expression. EphA7 is more restricted in its expression and is largely nonoverlapping with ephrin-A5. In mutant mice lacking one or both receptors or ephrin-A5, the appearance of the venteroposterolateral (VPL) and venteroposteromedial (VPM) nuclear complex is altered compared to wild type mice.

We previously reported that the atypical RhoA GTPase Rnd2 promotes the radial migration of mouse cerebral cortical neurons (Nature 455(7209):114-8, 2008; Neuron 69(6):1069-84, 2011), but its downstream signalling pathway is not well understood. RESULTS: We have identified BTB-domain containing adaptor for Cul3-mediated RhoA degradation 2 (Bacurd2) as a novel interacting partner to Rnd2, which promotes radial migration within the developing cerebral cortex. We find that Bacurd2 binds Rnd2 at its C-terminus, and this interaction is critical to its cell migration function. We show that forced expression or knockdown of Bacurd2 impairs neuronal migration within the embryonic cortex and alters the morphology of immature neurons. Our in vivo cellular analysis reveals that Bacurd2 influences the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of radially migrating neurons in a cell autonomous fashion. When we addressed the potential signalling relationship between Bacurd2 and Rnd2 using a Bacurd2-Rnd2 chimeric construct, our results suggest that Bacurd2 and Rnd2 could interact to promote radial migration within the embryonic cortex.

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the molecular interplay of the Fshr promoter involved in the transactivation by AHR in mouse granulosa cells. We found that AHR activates the Fshr promoter through the region from -209 to -99 bp.

To better understand the molecular mechanisms by which this sequence variation modifies platelet function, we produced transgenic knockin mice expressing a Pro32Pro33 integrin beta3. Consistent with reports utilizing human platelets, we found significantly reduced bleeding and clotting times, as well as increased in vivo thrombosis, in Pro32Pro33 homozygous mice. These alterations paralleled increases in platelet attachment and spreading onto fibrinogen resulting from enhanced integrin alphaIIbbeta3 function. Activation with protease-activated receptor 4- activating peptide, the main thrombin signaling receptor in mice, showed no significant difference in activation of Pro32Pro33 mice as compared with controls, suggesting that inside-out signaling remains intact. However, under unstimulated conditions, the Pro32Pro33 mutation led to elevated Src phosphorylation, facilitated by increased talin interactions with the beta3 cytoplasmic domain, indicating that the alphaIIbbeta3 intracellular domains are primed for activation while the ligand-binding domain remains unchanged. Acute dosing of animals with a Src inhibitor was sufficient to rescue the clotting phenotype in knockin mice to wild-type levels.

Astrocyte activation occurs in response to central nervous system (CNS) insult and is considered a double edged sword in many pathological conditions. We propose that reduced glutamatergic and trophic response of astrocytes to activation may, over time, lead to accumulative CNS damage, thus facilitating neurodegeneration. We found that astrocytes derived from the SOD1(G93A) ALS mouse model exhibit a reduced glutamatergic and trophic response to specific activations compared to their wild-type counterparts. Wild-type astrocytes exhibited a robust response when activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), G5 or treated with ceftriaxone in many parameters evaluated. These parameters include increased expression of GLT-1 and GLAST the two major astrocytic glutamate transporters, accompanied by a marked increase in the astrocytic glutamate clearance and up-regulation of neurtrophic factor expression. However, not only do un-treated SOD1(G93A) astrocytes take up glutamate less efficiently, but in response to activation they show no further increase in any of the glutamatergic parameters evaluated. Furthermore, activation of wild-type astrocytes, but not SOD1(G93A) astrocytes, improved their ability to protect the motor neuron cell line NSC-34 from glutamate induced excitotoxicity.

Reduced contraction in DKO mice was associated with delayed clearance of infection and sustained T-cell proliferation during the normal contraction interval. Mechanistically, sustained T-cell proliferation mapped to prolonged infection in the absence of TNF; however, reduced contraction required the additional absence of perforin since T cells in mice lacking either TNF or perforin (singly deficient) underwent normal contraction. Thus, while T-cell contraction after acute infection is independent of peforin, a perforin-dependent pathway plays a previously unappreciated role to mediate contraction of antigen-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells during prolonged L. monocytogenes infection.", "publish_time": "2012-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 12, "3D structure": 9, "gel/blot": 2, "macromolecule sequence": 4}}, "5763711": {"cord_uid": "5763711", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Tgfbi/Bigh3 silencing activates ERK in mouse retina.", "abstract": "BIGH3 is a secreted protein, part of the extracellular matrix where it interacts with collagen and integrins on the cell surface.

Here we show that Purkinje loss in a mouse model of Huntington's disease also correlates with a 200% increase in cerebellar tPA activity. That elevated tPA levels arise in a variety of ataxia models suggests that tPA is a common mediator of Purkinje damage. To address the specific contribution of tPA to cerebellar dysfunction we studied the T4 mice line that overexpresses murine tPA in postnatal neurons through the Thy1.2 gene promoter, which directs preferential expression to Purkinje cells within the cerebellum.

In contrast, T4 mice displayed no evidence of microgliosis, nor any changes in interneuron density, nor alteration in the cerebellar granular neuron layer.

Fz-PCP is conserved in vertebrates, but an understanding in vertebrates of whether and how Fat-PCP polarizes cells, and its relationship to Fz-PCP signaling, is lacking.

Here, we investigate the role and mechanisms of Fat-PCP during neuronal migration using the murine facial branchiomotor (FBM) neurons as a model. We find that Fat4 and Dchs1 are expressed in complementary gradients and are required for the collective tangential migration of FBM neurons and for their PCP. Fat4 and Dchs1 are required intrinsically within the FBM neurons and extrinsically within the neuroepithelium. Remarkably, Fat-PCP and Fz-PCP regulate FBM neuron migration along orthogonal axes. Disruption of the Dchs1 gradients by mosaic inactivation of Dchs1 alters FBM neuron polarity and migration. This study implies that PCP in vertebrates can be regulated via gradients of Fat4 and Dchs1 expression, which establish intracellular polarity across FBM cells during their migration.

Early in development, however, when glutamatergic synapses are only beginning to form, nicotinic cholinergic excitation is already widespread; it is mediated by acetylcholine activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that generate waves of activity across brain regions. A major class of nAChRs contributing at this time is a species containing alpha7 subunits (alpha7-nAChRs). These receptors are highly permeable to calcium, influence a variety of calcium-dependent events, and are diversely distributed throughout the developing CNS. Here we show that alpha7-nAChRs unexpectedly promote formation of glutamatergic synapses during development. The dependence on alpha7-nAChRs becomes clear when comparing wild-type (WT) mice with mice constitutively lacking the alpha7-nAChR gene. Ultrastructural analysis, immunostaining, and patch-clamp recording all reveal synaptic deficits when alpha7-nAChR input is absent. Similarly, nicotinic activation of alpha7-nAChRs in WT organotypic culture, as well as cell culture, increases the number of glutamatergic synapses. RNA interference demonstrates that the alpha7-nAChRs must be expressed in the neuron being innervated for normal innervation to occur. Moreover, the deficits persist throughout the developmental period of major de novo synapse formation and are still fully apparent in the adult. GABAergic synapses, in contrast, are undiminished in number under such conditions. As a result, mice lacking alpha7-nAChRs have an altered balance in the excitatory/inhibitory input they receive.

The mechanism of MIP-133-induced apoptosis is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine if MIP-133 induces apoptosis and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells via the cytosolic phospholipase A(2alpha) (cPLA(2alpha)) pathway. METHODS: HCE cells were incubated with or without MIP-133 at doses of 7.5, 15, and 50 mug/mL for 6, 12, and 24 hours. The effects of cPLA(2alpha) inhibitors on cPLA(2alpha), arachidonic acid (AA) release, and apoptosis were tested in vitro. Inhibition of cPLA(2alpha) involved preincubating HCE cells for 1 hour with cPLA(2alpha) inhibitors (10 muM methyl-arachidonyl fluorophosphonate [MAFP] or 20 muM arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone [AACOCF3]) with or without MIP-133 for 24 hours. Expression of cPLA(2alpha) mRNA and enzyme was examined by RT-PCR and cPLA(2) activity assays, respectively. Apoptosis of corneal epithelial cells was determined by caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation assays. Expression of IL-8, IL-6, IL-1beta, and IFN-gamma was examined by RT-PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: MIP-133 induced significant cPLA(2alpha) (approximately two to four times) and AA release (approximately six times) from corneal cells while cPLA(2alpha) inhibitors significantly reduced cPLA(2alpha) (approximately two to four times) and AA release (approximately three times) (P < 0.05). cPLA(2alpha) inhibitors significantly inhibited MIP-133-induced DNA fragmentation approximately 7 to 12 times in HCE cells (P < 0.05). MIP-133 specifically activates cPLA(2alpha) enzyme activity in HCE cells, which is blocked by preincubation with anti-MIP-133 antibody. In addition, MIP-133 induced significant IL-8, IL-6, IL-1beta, and IFN-gamma production, approximately two to three times (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MIP-133 interacts with phospholipids on plasma membrane of HCE cells and activates cPLA(2alpha). cPLA(2alpha) is involved in apoptosis, AA release, and activation of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines from HCE cells. cPLA(2alpha) inhibitors may be a therapeutic target in Acanthamoeba keratitis.", "publish_time": "2012-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 13, "macromolecule sequence": 5}}, "5447777": {"cord_uid": "5447777", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Mutations in Hedgehog acyltransferase (Hhat) perturb Hedgehog signaling, resulting in severe acrania-holoprosencephaly-agnathia craniofacial defects.", "abstract": "Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a failure of the forebrain to bifurcate and is the most common structural malformation of the embryonic brain. Mutations in SHH underlie most familial (17%) cases of HPE; and, consistent with this, Shh is expressed in midline embryonic cells and tissues and their derivatives that are affected in HPE. It has long been recognized that a graded series of facial anomalies occurs within the clinical spectrum of HPE, as HPE is often found in patients together with other malformations such as acrania, anencephaly, and agnathia. However, it is not known if these phenotypes arise through a common etiology and pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate for the first time using mouse models that Hedgehog acyltransferase (Hhat) loss-of-function leads to holoprosencephaly together with acrania and agnathia, which mimics the severe condition observed in humans. Hhat is required for post-translational palmitoylation of Hedgehog (Hh) proteins; and, in the absence of Hhat, Hh secretion from producing cells is diminished. We show through downregulation of the Hh receptor Ptch1 that loss of Hhat perturbs long-range Hh signaling, which in turn disrupts Fgf, Bmp and Erk signaling. Collectively, this leads to abnormal patterning and extensive apoptosis within the craniofacial primordial, together with defects in cartilage and bone differentiation. Therefore our work shows that Hhat loss-of-function underscrores HPE; but more importantly it provides a mechanism for the co-occurrence of acrania, holoprosencephaly, and agnathia.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated tamoxifen-inducible cardiac myocyte-specific mice lacking both GSK-3 isoforms (double knockout). We unexpectedly found that cardiac myocyte GSK-3 is essential for cardiac homeostasis and overall survival. Serial echocardiographic analysis reveals that within 2 weeks of tamoxifen treatment, double-knockout hearts leads to excessive dilatative remodeling and ventricular dysfunction. Further experimentation with isolated adult cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts from double-knockout implicated cardiac myocytes intrinsic factors responsible for observed phenotype. Mechanistically, loss of GSK-3 in adult cardiac myocytes resulted in induction of mitotic catastrophe, a previously unreported event in cardiac myocytes. Double-knockout cardiac myocytes showed cell cycle progression resulting in increased DNA content and multinucleation. However, increased cell cycle activity was rivaled by marked activation of DNA damage, cell cycle checkpoint activation, and mitotic catastrophe-induced apoptotic cell death. Importantly, mitotic catastrophe was also confirmed in isolated adult cardiac myocytes.

In response to oxLDL-IC, heat-shock protein 70B' (HSP70B') was up-regulated and localized with redistributed ASMase in the endosomal compartment outside the lysosome. Treatment with oxLDL-IC induced the formation and release of HSP70-containing and IL-1beta-containing exosomes via an ASMase-dependent mechanism.

Viral entry represents a potential multifaceted target for antiviral intervention; however, to date, FDA-approved inhibitors of HCV cell entry are unavailable. Here we show that the cellular Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) cholesterol uptake receptor is an HCV entry factor amendable to therapeutic intervention. Specifically, NPC1L1 expression is necessary for HCV infection, as silencing or antibody-mediated blocking of NPC1L1 impairs cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) infection initiation. In addition, the clinically available FDA-approved NPC1L1 antagonist ezetimibe potently blocks HCV uptake in vitro via a virion cholesterol-dependent step before virion-cell membrane fusion. Moreover, ezetimibe inhibits infection by all major HCV genotypes in vitro and in vivo delays the establishment of HCV genotype 1b infection in mice with human liver grafts.

In this study, we show that double null mutation of Protein Kinase C delta and epsilon causes embryonic lethality at approximately E9.5. At this stage, whole mount staining of the endothelial marker CD31 in double null embryos revealed defective blood vessel formation. Moreover, culture of double deficient mouse allantois showed impaired endothelial cell organization, and analyses of double deficient embryo sections showed dilated vessels, decreased endothelial-specific adherent junctions, and decreased contact of endothelial cells with mural cells. Protein kinase C delta and epsilon also appeared essential for vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation, since alpha-smooth muscle actin, a classical marker for vascular smooth muscle cells, was almost undetectable in double deficient embryonic aorta at E9.5.

Using knock-in mice, transgenic mice and retroviral transgene delivery, we demonstrate the existence of several different populations of glutamatergic olfactory bulb neurons, the progenitors of which are ND1+ and ND1- lineage-restricted, and are temporally and regionally separated. We show that the first olfactory bulb glutamatergic neurons produced - the mitral cells - can be divided into molecularly diverse subpopulations.

However, the roles of CD47 in the immune responses to viral infection or vaccination remain unknown. We investigated the role of CD47 in inducing humoral immune responses after intranasal infection with virus or immunization with influenza virus-like particles (VLPs). Virus infection or vaccination with VLPs containing hemagglutinin from A/PR8/34 influenza virus induced higher levels of antigen-specific IgG2c isotype dominant antibodies in CD47-deficient (CD47KO) mice than in wild-type (WT) mice. CD47KO mice with vaccination showed greater protective efficacy against lethal challenge, as evidenced by no loss in body weight and reduced lung viral titers compared to WT mice. In addition, inflammatory responses which include cytokine production, leukocyte infiltrates, and gamma interferon-producing CD4(+) T cells, as well as an anti-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-10), were reduced in the lungs of vaccinated CD47KO mice after challenge with influenza virus. Analysis of lymphocytes indicated that GL7(+) germinal center B cells were induced at higher levels in the draining lymph nodes of CD47KO mice compared to those in WT mice. Notably, CD47KO mice exhibited significant increases in the numbers of antigen-specific memory B cells in spleens and plasma cells in bone marrow despite their lower levels of background IgG antibodies. These results suggest that CD47 plays a role as a negative regulator in inducing protective immune responses to influenza vaccination. IMPORTANCE: Molecular mechanisms that control B cell activation to produce protective antibodies upon viral vaccination remain poorly understood. The CD47 molecule is known to be a ligand for the inhibitory receptor signal regulatory protein alpha and expressed on the surfaces of most immune cell types. CD47 was previously demonstrated to play an important role in modulating the migration of monocytes, neutrophils, polymorphonuclear neutrophils, and dendritic cells into the inflamed tissues. The results of this study demonstrate new roles of CD47 in negatively regulating the induction of protective IgG antibodies, germinal center B cells, and plasma cells secreting antigen-specific antibodies, as well as macrophages, upon influenza vaccination and challenge. As a consequence, vaccinated CD47-deficient mice demonstrated better control of influenza viral infection and enhanced protection.

To overcome early neonatal lethality, we generated Lgl1 conditional knockout mice mediated by Pax2-Cre, which is expressed in almost all cells in the cerebellum, and we examined the functions of Lgl1 in the cerebellum. Impaired motor coordination was detected in the mutant mice. Consistent with this abnormal behaviour, homozygous mice possessed a smaller cerebellum with fewer lobes, reduced granule precursor cell (GPC) proliferation, decreased Purkinje cell (PC) quantity and dendritic dysplasia. Loss of Lgl1 in the cerebellum led to hyperproliferation and impaired differentiation of neural progenitors in ventricular zone. Based on the TUNEL assay, we observed increased apoptosis in the cerebellum of mutant mice. We proposed that impaired differentiation and increased apoptosis may contribute to decreased PC quantity. To clarify the effect of Lgl1 on cerebellar granule cells, we used Math1-Cre to specifically delete Lgl1 in granule cells. Interestingly, the Lgl1-Math1 conditional knockout mice exhibited normal proliferation of GPCs and cerebellar development. Thus, we speculated that the reduction in the proliferation of GPCs in Lgl1-Pax2 conditional knockout mice may be secondary to the decreased number of PCs, which secrete the mitogenic factor Sonic hedgehog to regulate GPC proliferation.

The oral invagination that reaches the brain from the mouth is referred to as Rathke's pouch, with the tip forming the adenohypophysis and the stalk disappearing after the earliest stages of development. In tetrapods, formation of the cranial base establishes a definitive barrier between the pituitary and oral cavity; however, numerous extinct and extant vertebrate species retain an open buccohypophyseal canal in adulthood, a vestige of the stalk of Rathke's pouch. Little is currently known about the formation and function of this structure. Here we have investigated molecular mechanisms driving the formation of the buccohypophyseal canal and their evolutionary significance. RESULTS: We show that Rathke's pouch is located at a boundary region delineated by endoderm, neural crest-derived oral mesenchyme and the anterior limit of the notochord, using CD1, R26R-Sox17-Cre and R26R-Wnt1-Cre mouse lines. As revealed by synchrotron X-ray microtomography after iodine staining in mouse embryos, the pouch has a lobulated three-dimensional structure that embraces the descending diencephalon during pituitary formation. Polaris(fl/fl); Wnt1-Cre, Ofd1(-/-) and Kif3a(-/-) primary cilia mouse mutants have abnormal sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling and all present with malformations of the anterior pituitary gland and midline structures of the anterior cranial base. Changes in the expressions of Shh downstream genes are confirmed in Gas1(-/-) mice. From an evolutionary perspective, persistence of the buccohypophyseal canal is a basal character for all vertebrates and its maintenance in several groups is related to a specific morphology of the midline that can be related to modulation in Shh signaling. CONCLUSION: These results provide insight into a poorly understood ancestral vertebrate structure.

Neocortical absence of HuR alters the phosphorylation states of initiation and elongation factors in the core translation machinery. In addition, HuR regulates the temporally specific positioning of functionally related mRNAs into the active translation sites, the polysomes. HuR also determines the specificity of neocortical polysomes by defining their combinatorial composition of ribosomal proteins and initiation and elongation factors.

Dysmorphogenesis of the fourth arch arteries can result in interruption of the aortic arch type B, typically found in DiGeorge syndrome. Tbx1 haploinsufficient embryos, which model DiGeorge syndrome, display fourth arch artery defects during formation of the vessels. Recovery from such defects is a documented yet unexplained phenotype in Tbx1 haploinsufficiency. OBJECTIVE: To understand the nature of fourth arch artery growth recovery in Tbx1 haploinsufficiency and its underlying genetic control. METHODS AND RESULTS: We categorized vessel phenotypes of Tbx1 heterozygotes as hypoplastic or aplastic at the conclusion of pharyngeal artery formation and compared these against the frequency of vessel defects scored at the end of great vessel development. The frequency of hypoplastic vessels decreased during embryogenesis, whereas no reduction of vessel aplasia was seen, implying recovery is attributable to remodeling of hypoplastic vessels. We showed that Smad7, an inhibitory Smad within the transforming growth factor-beta pathway, is regulated by Tbx1, is required for arch artery remodeling, and genetically interacts with Tbx1 in this process. Tbx1 and Tbx1;Smad7 haploinsufficiency affected several remodeling processes; however, concurrent haploinsufficiency particularly impacted on the earliest stage of vascular smooth muscle cell vessel coverage and subsequent fibronectin deposition. Conditional reconstitution of Smad7 with a Tbx1Cre driver indicated that the interaction between the 2 genes is cell autonomous.

Human congenital disorders of ganglioside biosynthesis invariably result in intellectual disability and are often associated with intractable seizures. To probe the mechanisms of ganglioside functions, affinity-captured ganglioside-binding proteins from rat cerebellar granule neurons were identified by quantitative proteomic mass spectrometry. Of the six proteins that bound selectively to the major brain ganglioside GT1b (GT1b:GM1 > 4; p < 10(-4)), three regulate neurotransmitter receptor trafficking: Thorase (ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 1), soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein (gamma-SNAP), and the transmembrane protein Nicalin. Thorase facilitates endocytosis of GluR2 subunit-containing AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in an ATPase-dependent manner; its deletion in mice results in learning and memory deficits (J. Zhang et al., 2011b). GluR2-containing AMPARs did not bind GT1b, but bound specifically to another ganglioside, GM1. Addition of noncleavable ATP (ATPgammaS) significantly disrupted ganglioside binding, whereas it enhanced AMPAR association with Thorase, NSF, and Nicalin. Mutant mice lacking GT1b expressed markedly higher brain Thorase, whereas Thorase-null mice expressed higher GT1b. Treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with sialidase, which cleaves GT1b (and other sialoglycans), resulted in a significant reduction in the size of surface GluR2 puncta. These data support a model in which GM1-bound GluR2-containing AMPARs are functionally segregated from GT1b-bound AMPAR-trafficking complexes. Release of ganglioside binding may enhance GluR2-containing AMPAR association with its trafficking complexes, increasing endocytosis.

In this model, delayed ischemic muscle repair observed in old mice was associated with an impaired upregulation of Gli1.

We observe a widespread requirement for Rac1 in axon growth and guidance and a cell-autonomous defect in axon growth in Rac1 (-/-) motor neurons in culture. Neuronal death, presumably a secondary consequence of the axon growth and/or guidance defects, was observed in multiple locations. Following deletion of Rac1 in the forebrain, thalamocortical axons were misrouted inferiorly, with the majority projecting to the contralateral thalamus and a minority projecting ipsilaterally to the ventral cortex, a pattern of misrouting that is indistinguishable from the pattern previously observed in Frizzled3 (-/-) and Celsr3 (-/-) forebrains. In the limbs, motor-neuron-specific deletion of Rac1 produced a distinctive stalling of axons within the dorsal nerve of the hindlimb but a much milder loss of axons in the ventral hindlimb and forelimb nerves, a pattern that is virtually identical to the one previously observed in Frizzled3 (-/-) limbs.

Evidence, mainly from knockout mice, has suggested that ITK plays a particularly important function in Th2 cells and this has prompted significant efforts to discover ITK inhibitors for the treatment of allergic disease. However, ITK is known to have functions outside of its kinase domain and in general kinase knockouts are often not good models for the behaviour of small molecule inhibitors. Consequently we have developed a transgenic mouse where the wild type Itk allele has been replaced by a kinase dead Itk allele containing an inactivating K390R point mutation (Itk-KD mice). We have characterised the immune phenotype of these naive mice and their responses to airway inflammation. Unlike Itk knockout (Itk-/-) mice, T-cells from Itk-KD mice can polymerise actin in response to CD3 activation. The lymph nodes from Itk-KD mice showed more prominent germinal centres than wild type mice and serum antibody levels were significantly abnormal. Unlike the Itk-/-, gammadelta T cells in the spleens of the Itk-KD mice had an impaired ability to secrete Th2 cytokines in response to anti-CD3 stimulation whilst the expression of ICOS was not significantly different to wild type. However ICOS expression is markedly increased on alphabetaCD3+ cells from the spleens of naive Itk-KD compared to WT mice. The Itk-KD mice were largely protected from inflammatory symptoms in an Ovalbumin model of airway inflammation.

To investigate the role of VEGF-A and endothelial cells (ECs) in adult islets, we used complementary genetic approaches to temporally inactivate VEGF-A in developing mouse pancreatic and islet progenitor cells or in adult beta-cells. Inactivation of VEGF-A early in development dramatically reduced pancreatic and islet vascularization, leading to reduced beta-cell proliferation in both developing and adult islets and, ultimately, reduced beta-cell mass and impaired glucose clearance. When VEGF-A was inactivated in adult beta-cells, islet vascularization was reduced twofold. Surprisingly, even after 3 months of reduced islet vascularization, islet architecture and beta-cell gene expression, mass, and function were preserved with only a minimal abnormality in glucose clearance. These data show that normal pancreatic VEGF-A expression is critical for the recruitment of ECs and the subsequent stimulation of endocrine cell proliferation during islet development. In contrast, although VEGF-A is required for maintaining the specialized vasculature observed in normal adult islets, adult beta-cells can adapt and survive long-term reductions in islet vascularity.

By using an efficient mouse secondary fibroblast reprogramming system with doxycycline (DOX) inducible Yamanaka's transcription factors delivered by piggyBac (PB) transposition (2 degrees F/1B MEF), we show that SIRT1 knockdown decreased while resveratrol (RSV) increased the efficiency of iPSC formation. The treatments were associated with altered acetylated p53 and its downstream Nanog but not p21 expression. The stimulatory effect was also confirmed by SIRT1 over-expression, which stimulated the formation of colonies with induced Nanog and reduced p21 expression. Furthermore, the effects of RSV and SIRT1 knockdown on reprogramming were most pronounced during the initiation phase of reprogramming. MicroRNA-34a is a known regulator of SIRT1. Its inhibitor increased, while its mimics reduced iPSC formation. The stimulatory effect of SIRT1 during reprogramming was also confirmed in the primary MEF.

In this widely used application, glucose uptake by tumors is monitored by positron emission tomography of the labeled glucose analogue 2[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG). Despite its widespread clinical use, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that determine FDG uptake-and that underlie the heterogeneity observed across cancers-remain poorly understood. In this study, we compared FDG uptake in mammary tumors driven by the Akt1, c-MYC, HER2/neu, Wnt1, or H-Ras oncogenes in genetically engineered mice, correlating it to tumor growth, cell proliferation, and expression levels of gene involved in key steps of glycolytic metabolism. We found that FDG uptake by tumors was dictated principally by the driver oncogene and was not independently associated with tumor growth or cellular proliferation. Oncogene downregulation resulted in a rapid decrease in FDG uptake, preceding effects on tumor regression, irrespective of the baseline level of uptake. FDG uptake correlated positively with expression of hexokinase-2 (HK2) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha) and associated negatively with PFK-2b expression and p-AMPK. The correlation between HK2 and FDG uptake was independent of all variables tested, including the initiating oncogene, suggesting that HK2 is an independent predictor of FDG uptake. In contrast, expression of Glut1 was correlated with FDG uptake only in tumors driven by Akt or HER2/neu. Together, these results demonstrate that the oncogenic pathway activated within a tumor is a primary determinant of its FDG uptake, mediated by key glycolytic enzymes, and provide a framework to interpret effects on this key parameter in clinical imaging.

Here, using single and double KO animals for the transcription factors Neurogenin2 (Ngn2) and Achaete-scute homolog 1 (Ascl1), we found that the expression of a specific subset of imprinted genes is controlled by these proneural genes. Using in situ hybridization and quantitative PCR, we determined that five imprinted transcripts situated at the Dlk1-Gtl2 locus (Dlk1, Gtl2, Mirg, Rian, Rtl1) are upregulated in the dorsal telencephalon of Ngn2 KO mice. This suggests that Ngn2 influences the expression of the entire Dlk1-Gtl2 locus, independently of the parental origin of the transcripts. Interestingly 14 other imprinted genes situated at other imprinted loci were not affected by the loss of Ngn2. Finally, using Ngn2/Ascl1 double KO mice, we show that the upregulation of genes at the Dlk1-Gtl2 locus in Ngn2 KO animals requires a functional copy of Ascl1.

METHODS: Expression of a total of 113 angiogenesis-related genes during murine brain development has been analyzed using low-density array systems designed for angiogenesis-related genes. Bai1 (brain specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1), a recently identified novel anti-angiogenic gene, has been selected for further characterization.

This study proposes that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is responsible for making astrocyte morphology more complex and hypertrophic in response to an inflammatory stimulus such as lipopolysaccharide. Primary astrocytes isolated from perinatal brains developed more branches in the presence of FGF8 or lesser branches in the presence of FGF2. Introduction of the constitutively active form of the FGF receptor 3 (caFGFR3) into the brain increases the structural complexity, with greater glial fibrillary acidic protein level in astrocytes, while overexpression of a dominant-negative form of FGFR3 (dnFGFR3) reduces it. Treatment of FGF8 facilitated the wound-healing process of primary astrocytes in vitro by changing their morphology, indicating that the FGF signal may control the responsiveness of astrocytes in injury conditions. Finally, the blockade of FGF signaling by introducing dnFGFR3 at the site of reactive gliosis reduces astrocyte branch formation and minimizes hypertrophic responses during reactive gliosis.

The Ad/N1ICD LPS resembles human dedifferentiated LPS in histological appearance, anatomical localization, and gene expression signature.

Although concomitant Pten deletion normalizes the glucose metabolism of Ad/N1ICD mice, it dramatically accelerates the LPS prognosis and malignancy.

Accordingly, synthetic Ppargamma ligand supplementation induces redifferentiation of Ad/N1ICD adipocytes and tumor cells, and prevents LPS development in Ad/N1ICD mice.

Wnt5a, a ligand of the PCP pathway, signals through the Ror2/Vangl2 or the Vangl2/Ryk complex to regulate limb development along the proximal-distal axis in mice. Based on the interaction between Van Gogh and Prickle in Drosophila, we hypothesized the vertebrate Prickle1 has a similar function as Vangl2 in limb development. RESULTS: We show Prickle1 is expressed in the skeletal condensates that will differentiate into chondrocytes and later form bones. Disrupted Prickle1 function in Prickle1(C251X/C251X) mouse mutants alters expression of genes such as Bmp4, Fgf8, Vangl2, and Wnt5a. These expression changes correlate with shorter and wider bones in the limbs and loss of one phalangeal segment in digits 2-5 of Prickle1C251X mutants. These growth defects along the proximal-distal axis are also associated with increased cell death in the growing digit tip, reduced cell death in the interdigital membrane, and disrupted chondrocyte polarity.

Alternative splicing of Col2a1 precursor mRNA is a developmentally-regulated event that only occurs in chondrogenic tissue. Normally, chondroprogenitor cells synthesize predominantly exon 2-containing mRNA isoforms (type IIA and IID) while Col2a1 mRNA devoid of exon 2 (type IIB) is the major isoform produced by differentiated chondrocytes. Another isoform, IIC, has also been identified that contains a truncated exon 2 and is not translated into protein. The biological significance of this IIA/IID to IIB splicing switch is not known. Utilizing a splice site targeting knock-in approach, a 4 nucleotide mutation was created to convert the 5' splice site of Col2a1 exon 2 from a weak, non-consensus sequence to a strong, consensus splice site. This resulted in apparent expression of only the IIA mRNA isoform, as confirmed in vitro by splicing of a type II procollagen mini-gene containing the 5' splice site mutation. To test the splice site targeting approach in vivo, homozygote mice engineered to retain IIA exon 2 (Col2a1(+ex2)) were generated.

The PPN neurons do not only provide cholinergic and non-cholinergic inputs to several subcortical brain areas but they are also targets of cholinergic and other different neuromodulatory actions.

Using slice electrophysiology, we provide evidence in the present work that cholinergic neurons possess M-current, whereas GABAergic neurons lack it. The M-current contributes to certain functional differences of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, as spike frequency adaptation, action potential firing frequency or the amplitude difference of medium afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs). Furthermore, we showed that high threshold membrane potential oscillation with high power, around 20 Hz frequency is a functional property of almost all cholinergic cells, whereas GABAergic neurons have only low amplitude oscillations. Blockade of the M-current abolished the oscillatory activity at 20 Hz, and largely diminished it at other frequencies.

However, a more complex picture is emerging in which, in addition to a group of shared phenotypes, diverse RP gene-specific phenotypes are observed. Here we report the first two mouse mutations (Rps7(Mtu) and Rps7(Zma)) of ribosomal protein S7 (Rps7), a gene that has been implicated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Rps7 disruption results in decreased body size, abnormal skeletal morphology, mid-ventral white spotting, and eye malformations. These phenotypes are reported in other murine RP mutants and, as demonstrated for some other RP mutations, are ameliorated by Trp53 deficiency. Interestingly, Rps7 mutants have additional overt malformations of the developing central nervous system and deficits in working memory, phenotypes that are not reported in murine or human RP gene mutants.

Deletion of Sgpp2, which is mainly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, significantly reduced dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis severity, whereas deletion of ubiquitously expressed Sgpp1 slightly worsened colitis. Moreover, Sgpp1 deletion enhanced expression of multifunctional proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta, activation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and immune cell infiltration into the colon. Conversely, Sgpp2-null mice failed to mount a DSS-induced systemic inflammatory response.

Infection with one of the four serotypes of DENV results in a transient period of protection against reinfection with all serotypes (cross-protection), followed by lifelong immunity to the infecting serotype. While a protective role for neutralizing antibody responses is well established, the contribution of T cells to reinfection is less clear, especially during heterotypic reinfection. This study investigates the role of T cells during homotypic and heterotypic DENV reinfection. Mice were sequentially infected with homotypic or heterotypic DENV serotypes, and T cell subsets were depleted before the second infection to assess the role of DENV-primed T cells during reinfection. Mice primed nonlethally with DENV were protected against reinfection with either a homotypic or heterotypic serotype 2 weeks later. Homotypic priming induced a robust neutralizing antibody response, whereas heterotypic priming elicited binding, but nonneutralizing antibodies. CD8(+) T cells were required for protection against heterotypic, but not homotypic, reinfection. These results suggest that T cells can contribute crucially to protection against heterotypic reinfection in situations where humoral responses alone may not be protective. Our findings have important implications for vaccine design, as they suggest that inducing both humoral and cellular responses during vaccination may maximize protective efficacy across all DENV serotypes. IMPORTANCE: Dengue virus is present in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical regions. Infection with dengue virus can be asymptomatic, but it can also progress into the potentially lethal severe dengue disease. There are four closely related dengue virus serotypes. Infection with one serotype results in a transient period of resistance against all serotypes (cross-protection), followed by lifelong resistance to the infecting serotype, but not the other ones. The duration and mechanisms of the transient cross-protection period remain elusive. This study investigates the contribution of cellular immunity to cross-protection using mouse models of DENV infection. Our results demonstrate that cellular immunity is crucial to mediate cross-protection against reinfection with a different serotype, but not for protection against reinfection with the same serotype.

When neuronal activity is chronically suppressed, neurons increase synaptic strength across all affected synapses via synaptic scaling. One mechanism for this change is alteration of synaptic AMPA receptor (AMPAR) accumulation. Although decreased intracellular Ca2+ levels caused by chronic inhibition of neuronal activity are believed to be an important trigger of synaptic scaling, the mechanism of Ca2+-mediated AMPAR-dependent synaptic scaling is not yet understood. Here, we use dissociated mouse cortical neurons and employ Ca2+ imaging, electrophysiological, cell biological, and biochemical approaches to describe a novel mechanism in which homeostasis of Ca2+ signaling modulates activity deprivation-induced synaptic scaling by three steps: (1) suppression of neuronal activity decreases somatic Ca2+ signals; (2) reduced activity of calcineurin, a Ca2+-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, increases synaptic expression of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs (CPARs) by stabilizing GluA1 phosphorylation; and (3) Ca2+ influx via CPARs restores CREB phosphorylation as a homeostatic response by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from the ER.

However, little is known about the role of serotonin signaling through 5-HT1A receptors between the emergence of normal anxiety behavior after weaning, and the mature adult phenotype. Here, we use both transgenic and pharmacological approaches in male mice, to identify a sensitive period for 5-HT1A function in the stabilization of circuits mediating anxious behavior during adolescence. Using a transgenic approach we show that suppression of 5-HT1A receptor expression beginning in early adolescence results in an anxiety-like phenotype in the open field test. We further demonstrate that treatment with the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100,635 between postnatal day (P)35 and P50, but not at later timepoints, results in altered anxiety in ethologically based conflict tests like the open field test and elevated plus maze. This change in anxiety behavior occurs without impacting behavior in the more depression-related sucrose preference test or forced swim test. The treatment with WAY 100,635 does not affect adult 5-HT1A expression levels, but leads to increased expression of the serotonin transporter in the raphe, along with enhanced serotonin levels in both the prefrontal cortex and raphe that correlate with the behavioral changes observed in adult mice. This work demonstrates that signaling through 5-HT1A receptors during adolescence (a time when pathological anxiety emerges), but not early adulthood, is critical in regulating anxiety setpoints.

Using a cre-loxP approach we have elucidated the role of the TGFbeta type I receptor tyrosine kinase, ALK5, in epithelial-mesenchymal cross talk during lung morphogenesis.

Osteopontin is a phosphorylated acidic glycoprotein that accumulates within the aortic leaflets and labels VIC activation even in noncalcified asymptomatic patients. Despite this, osteopontin protects VICs against in vitro calcification. Here, we hypothesize that the specific interaction of osteopontin with CD44v6, and the related intracellular pathway, prevents calcium deposition in human-derived VICs from patients with aortic valve sclerosis. APPROACH AND RESULTS: On informed consent, 23 patients and 4 controls were enrolled through the cardiac surgery and heart transplant programs. Human aortic valves and VICs were tested for osteogenic transdifferentiation, ex vivo and in vitro. Osteopontin-CD44 interaction was analyzed using proximity ligation assay and the signaling pathways investigated. A murine model based on angiotensin II infusion was used to mimic early pathological remodeling of the aortic valves. We report osteopontin-CD44 functional interaction as a hallmark of early stages of calcific aortic valve disease. We demonstrated that osteopontin-CD44 interaction mediates calcium deposition via phospho-Akt in VICs from patients with noncalcified aortic valve sclerosis.

Notch controls cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation in the developing heart and regulates cardiac remodelling in the stressed adult heart. Besides canonical Notch receptor activation in signal-receiving cells, Notch ligands can also activate Notch receptor-independent responses in signal-sending cells via release of their intracellular domain. We evaluated therefore the importance of Jagged1 (J1) intracellular domain (ICD)-mediated pathways in the postnatal heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: In cardiomyocytes, Jagged1 releases J1ICD, which then translocates into the nucleus and down-regulates Notch transcriptional activity. To study the importance of J1ICD in cardiac homeostasis, we generated transgenic mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible form of J1ICD, specifically in cardiomyocytes. Using this model, we demonstrate that J1ICD-mediated Notch inhibition diminishes proliferation in the neonatal cardiomyocyte population and promotes maturation. In the neonatal heart, a response via Wnt and Akt pathway activation is elicited as an attempt to compensate for the deficit in cardiomyocyte number resulting from J1ICD activation. In the stressed adult heart, J1ICD activation results in a dramatic reduction of the number of Notch signalling cardiomyocytes, blunts the hypertrophic response, and reduces the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes. Consistently, this occurs concomitantly with a significant down-regulation of the phosphorylation of the Akt effectors ribosomal S6 protein (S6) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein1 (4EBP1) controlling protein synthesis.

Whole kidney and glomerular hypertrophy, as well as renal inflammation, including monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 expression, NF-kappaB activation, and monocyte infiltration, was inhibited after short and long treatment with apelin. Apelin administration significantly reduced albuminuria at 6 mo. Short treatment with apelin was sufficient to reverse the downregulation of the antioxidant enzyme catalase. Expression of angiotensin II and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1) in kidneys from diabetic mice treated was not affected by apelin. These findings show for the first time that apelin exerts a protective effect on the diabetic kidney. Short administration is sufficient to reduce kidney and glomerular hypertrophy as well as renal inflammation, but prolonged treatment is required to improve albuminuria. This effect was independent of the activation of the renin angiotensin system but correlated with upregulation of the antioxidant catalase.

Although Ret signal transduction in vitro is augmented by translocation into lipid rafts via GFRalpha1, the existence and importance of lipid rafts in GDNF-Ret signaling under physiologic conditions is unresolved. A knock-in mouse was produced that replaced GFRalpha1 with GFRalpha1-TM, which contains a transmembrane (TM) domain instead of the GPI anchor. GFRalpha1-TM still binds GDNF and promotes Ret activation but does not translocate into rafts. In Gfralpha1(TM/TM) mice, GFRalpha1-TM is expressed, trafficked, and processed at levels identical to GFRalpha1. Although Gfralpha1(+/TM) mice are viable, Gfralpha1(TM/TM) mice display bilateral renal agenesis, lack enteric neurons in the intestines, and have motor axon guidance deficits, similar to Gfralpha1(-/-) mice.

Using Copper Fluor-3 (CF3), a new fluorescent Cu(+) sensor for one- and two-photon imaging, we show that neurons and neural tissue maintain basal stores of loosely bound copper that can be attenuated by chelation, which define a labile copper pool.

Partial knockout of Foxo1 in Foxo1(+/-) mice throughout the body led to accelerated skin wound healing with enhanced keratinocyte migration, reduced granulation tissue formation, and decreased collagen density, accompanied by an attenuated inflammatory response, but we observed no wound phenotype in Foxo3a(-/-) mice. Fibroblast growth factor 2, adiponectin, and notch1 genes were significantly increased at wound sites in Foxo1(+/-) mice, along with markedly altered extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and AKT phosphorylation. Similarly, transient knockdown of Foxo1 at the wound site by local delivery of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides enhanced skin wound healing. The link between FOXO1 and scarring extends to patients, in particular keloid scars, where we see FOXO1 expression markedly increased in fibroblasts and inflammatory cells within the otherwise normal dermis. This occurs in the immediate vicinity of the keloid by comparison to the center of the mature keloid, indicating that FOXO1 is associated with the overgrowth of this fibrotic response into adjacent normal skin.

We show that Smaug2 inhibits and Nanos1 promotes neurogenesis, with Smaug2 knockdown enhancing neurogenesis and depleting precursors, and Nanos1 knockdown inhibiting neurogenesis and maintaining precursors. Moreover, we show that Smaug2 likely regulates neurogenesis by silencing nanos1 mRNA. Specifically, Smaug2 knockdown inappropriately increases Nanos1 protein, and the Smaug2 knockdown-mediated neurogenesis is rescued by preventing this increase. Thus, Smaug2 and Nanos1 function as a bimodal translational repression switch to control neurogenesis, with Smaug2 acting in transcriptionally primed precursors to silence mRNAs important for neurogenesis, including nanos1 mRNA, and Nanos1 acting during the transition to neurons to repress the precursor state.

The vasculature expands by sprouting angiogenesis, during which tip cells form filopodia that incorporate into capillary loops. Although several molecules, such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa), are known to induce sprouting, the mechanism that terminates this process to ensure neovessel stability is still unknown. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P(1)) has been shown to mediate interaction between endothelial and mural cells during vascular maturation. In vitro studies have identified S1P(1) as a pro-angiogenic factor. Here, we show that S1P(1) acts as an endothelial cell (EC)-autonomous negative regulator of sprouting angiogenesis during vascular development. Severe aberrations in vessel size and excessive sprouting found in limbs of S1P(1)-null mouse embryos before vessel maturation imply a previously unknown, mural cell-independent role for S1P(1) as an anti-angiogenic factor. A similar phenotype observed when S1P(1) expression was blocked specifically in ECs indicates that the effect of S1P(1) on sprouting is EC-autonomous. Comparable vascular abnormalities in S1p(1) knockdown zebrafish embryos suggest cross-species evolutionary conservation of this mechanism. Finally, genetic interaction between S1P(1) and Vegfa suggests that these factors interplay to regulate vascular development, as Vegfa promotes sprouting whereas S1P(1) inhibits it to prevent excessive sprouting and fusion of neovessels.

Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 27, which establishes H3K27me3 repressive epigenetic marks that promote tissue-specific differentiation by silencing ectopic gene programs. OBJECTIVE: We studied the function of PRC2 in murine heart development using a tissue-restricted conditional inactivation strategy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inactivation of the PRC2 subunit Ezh2 by Nkx2-5(Cre) (Ezh2(NK)) caused lethal congenital heart malformations, namely, compact myocardial hypoplasia, hypertrabeculation, and ventricular septal defect. Candidate and genome-wide RNA expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of Ezh2(NK) heart identified genes directly repressed by EZH2. Among these were the potent cell cycle inhibitors Ink4a/b (inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 A and B), the upregulation of which was associated with decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation in Ezh2(NK). EZH2-repressed genes were enriched for transcriptional regulators of noncardiomyocyte expression programs such as Pax6, Isl1, and Six1. EZH2 was also required for proper spatiotemporal regulation of cardiac gene expression, because Hcn4, Mlc2a, and Bmp10 were inappropriately upregulated in ventricular RNA. PRC2 was also required later in heart development, as indicated by cardiomyocyte-restricted TNT-Cre inactivation of the PRC2 subunit Eed. However, Ezh2 inactivation by TNT-Cre did not cause an overt phenotype, likely because of functional redundancy with Ezh1. Thus, early Ezh2 inactivation by Nk2-5(Cre) caused later disruption of cardiomyocyte gene expression and heart development.

The identification of so far unknown inducers that regulate BOB.1/OBF.1 expression in B cells provides novel insights in the potential function of BOB.1/OBF.1 during different aspects of B-cell development and function.", "publish_time": "2015-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 4, "gel/blot": 1, "3D structure": 2, "macromolecule sequence": 7}}, "5800625": {"cord_uid": "5800625", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Mitochondrial H2O2 in Lung Antigen-Presenting Cells Blocks NF-kappaB Activation to Prevent Unwarranted Immune Activation.", "abstract": "Inhalation of environmental antigens such as allergens does not always induce inflammation in the respiratory tract. While antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells and macrophages, take up inhaled antigens, the cell-intrinsic molecular mechanisms that prevent an inflammatory response during this process, such as activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, are not well understood. Here, we show that the nuclear receptor PPARgamma plays a critical role in blocking NF-kappaB activation in response to inhaled antigens to preserve immune tolerance. Tolerance induction promoted mitochondrial respiration, generation of H2O2, and suppression of NF-kappaB activation in WT, but not PPARgamma-deficient, APCs. Forced restoration of H2O2 in PPARgamma-deficient cells suppressed IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kappaB activation. Conversely, scavenging reactive oxygen species from mitochondria promoted IkappaBalpha degradation with loss of regulatory and promotion of inflammatory T cell responses in vivo. Thus, communication between PPARgamma and the mitochondria maintains immune quiescence in the airways.", "publish_time": "2016-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"line chart": 17, "macromolecule sequence": 5, "3D structure": 3, "gel/blot": 8, "other diagram": 1, "fluorescence": 1}}, "5689192": {"cord_uid": "5689192", "source_x": "gxd", "title": "Regulation of Hematopoiesis and Methionine Homeostasis by mTORC1 Inhibitor NPRL2.", "abstract": "Nitrogen permease regulator-like 2 (NPRL2) is a component of a conserved complex that inhibits mTORC1 (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1) in response to amino acid insufficiency.

Moreover, NPRL2 KO embryos have significantly reduced methionine levels and exhibit phenotypes reminiscent of cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency. Consistent with this idea, NPRL2 KO liver and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) show defective processing of the cobalamin-transport protein transcobalamin 2, along with impaired lysosomal acidification and lysosomal gene expression. NPRL2 KO MEFs exhibit a significant defect in the cobalamin-dependent synthesis of methionine from homocysteine, which can be rescued by supplementation with cyanocobalamin.

To explore this possibility, we have characterized the expression and activity of the NADPH oxidase complex in trophoblast cells during the postimplantation period. Implantation sites and ectoplacental cones (EPCs) from 7.5-gestational day embryos from CD1 mice were used as a source for expression analyses of NADPH oxidase catalytic and regulatory subunits. EPCs grown in primary culture were used to investigate the production of superoxide anion through dihydroxyethidium oxidation in confocal microscopy and immunohistochemical assays. NADPH subunits Cybb (gp91phox), Cyba (p22phox), Ncf4 (p40phox), Ncf1 (p47phox), Ncf2 (p67phox), and Rac1 were expressed by trophoblast cells. The fundamental subunits of membrane CYBB and cytosolic NCF2 were markedly upregulated after phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) treatment, as detected by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Fluorescence microscopy imaging showed colocalization of cytosolic and plasma membrane NADPH oxidase subunits mainly after PMA treatment, suggesting assembly of the complex after enzyme activation. Cultured EPCs produced superoxide in a NADPH-dependent manner, associating the NADPH oxidase-mediated superoxide production with postimplantation trophoblast physiology.

An understanding of the factors that regulate the generation and recall capacities of memory T cells remains to be ascertained. Several cues indicate that two highly related cytokines, IL-2 and IL-15, share redundant functions in this process. To establish their combined roles in memory CD8(+) T-cell development, maintenance, and secondary responses, we compared the outcome of adoptively transferred IL2Rbeta(+/-) or IL2Rbeta(-/-) CD8(+) T cells after an acute viral infection in mice. Our results demonstrate that both IL-2 and IL-15 signals condition the differentiation of primary and secondary short-lived effector cells by altering the transcriptional network governing lineage choices. These two cytokines also regulate the homeostasis of the memory T-cell pool, with effector memory CD8(+) T cells being the most sensitive to these two interleukins. Noticeably, the inability to respond to both cytokines limits the proliferation and survival of primary and secondary effectors cells, whereas it does not preclude potent cytotoxic functions and viral control either initially or upon rechallenge.

A gain-of-function mutation in the 2c splice variant of the receptor's gene is associated with Crouzon syndrome, which is characterized by craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of one or more of the cranial vault sutures, leading to craniofacial maldevelopment. Insight into the molecular mechanism of craniosynostosis has identified the ERK-MAPK signaling cascade as a critical regulator of suture patency. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of FGFR2c-induced ERK-MAPK activation in the regulation of coronal suture development. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function Fgfr2c mutant mice have overlapping phenotypes, including coronal synostosis and craniofacial dysmorphia. In vivo analysis of coronal sutures in loss-of-function and gain-of-function models demonstrated fundamentally different pathogenesis underlying coronal suture synostosis. Calvarial osteoblasts from gain-of-function mice demonstrated enhanced osteoblastic function and maturation with concomitant increase in ERK-MAPK activation. In vitro inhibition with the ERK protein inhibitor U0126 mitigated ERK protein activation levels with a concomitant reduction in alkaline phosphatase activity. This study identifies FGFR2c-mediated ERK-MAPK signaling as a key mediator of craniofacial growth and coronal suture development.

In a large-scale high-throughput ENU mutagenesis screen we analyzed the offspring of paternally treated C3HeB/FeJ mice for obvious dysmorphologies. We identified a mutant suffering from rough coat and small eyes only in homozygotes; homozygous females turned out to be sterile. The mutation was mapped to chromosome 7 between the markers 116J6.1 and D7Mit294;4 other markers within this interval did not show any recombination among 160 F2-mutants. The critical interval (8.6 Mb) contains 3 candidate genes (Apoe, Six5, Opa3); none of them showed a mutation. Using exome sequencing, we identified a c.2209T>C mutation in the Xpd/Ercc2 gene leading to a Ser737Pro exchange. During embryonic development, the mutant eyes did not show major changes. Postnatal histological analyses demonstrated small cortical vacuoles; later, cortical cataracts developed. Since XPD/ERCC2 is involved in DNA repair, we checked also for the presence of the repair-associated histone gammaH2AX in the lens. During the time, when primary lens fiber cell nuclei are degraded, gammaH2AX was strongly expressed in the cell nuclei; later, it demarcates clearly the border of the lens cortex to the organelle-free zone. Moreover, we analyzed also whether seemingly healthy heterozygotes might be less efficient in repair of DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation than wild types. Peripheral lymphocytes irradiated by 1Gy Cs137 showed 6 hrs after irradiation significantly more gammaH2AX foci in heterozygotes than in wild types. These findings demonstrate the importance of XPD/ERCC2 not only for lens fiber cell differentiation, but also for the sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Based upon these data, we hypothesize that variations in the human XPD/ERCC2 gene might increase the susceptibility for several disorders besides Xeroderma pigmentosum in heterozygotes under particular environmental conditions.", "publish_time": "2015-01-01", "journal": "", "authors": "", "url": "", "pmcid": "", "modalities": {"residual": 1, "line chart": 3, "3D structure": 1, "other diagram": 23, "fluorescence": 7, "gel/blot": 2, "macromolecule sequence": 2}}}
